Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |3 of 46 
 
FOREWORD 
This report is the culmination of a joint effort between the Financial Services Commission (“the 
Commission”) as the regulator/supervisor of financial services and the Financial Investigation Agency 
(“the FIA”) as AML/CFT supervisor of Non-profit Organisations and Designated Non-Financial Businesses 
and Professions (DNFBPs) in the Virgin Islands.   
 
This assessment is the first sectoral assessment that specifically targets the risk of terrorist financing 
within the jurisdiction.  It follows the findings of the National Risk Assessment concluded in 2016, which 
looked broadly at the structures in place for the criminalisation of Terrorist Financing (“TF”) and the 
implementation of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions within the Virgin Islands.  This assessment 
has moved beyond that review of the effectiveness of the established legislative framework, to taking a 
critical look at the TF threats to which the Virgin Islands are exposed, and the TF risks posed by the sectors 
under each of our supervisory remits.  Conducting this assessment has ensured that we will be able to 
continue to take appropriate action to effectively mitigate and manage these and other emerging risks.   
 
The importance of identifying, understanding and mitigating the risk of TF as a result of the activities 
carried out in and from within the Virgin Islands cannot be underscored.  As supervisors we are cognizant 
of the need to comprehensively examine the threats and vulnerabilities that magnify this risk.  Such 
examination not only ensures compliance with international standards, but aids in maintaining the safety 
of the citizens of the Virgin Islands and our reputation as a leading International Financial Centre.   
 
All relevant sectors should pay particular attention to the findings of this report as this will help you to 
better identify the particular TF risks you face and allow you to take the necessary actions to mitigate 
these risks.  Each sector is unique as are the risks identified.  Entities should therefore examine the findings 
of the report and integrate these findings into their own institutional risk assessments and those of their 
clients. 
 
The Commission and the FIA are proud of the strong and robust AML/CFT regime in place to combat the 
risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation.  As supervisors we remain 
committed to identifying and responding to such risks.  We are confident that with continued cooperation 
and collaboration between the public and private sectors, we will be able to maintain and enhance our 
global reputation as a place to conduct legitimate business as we continue to play our part in the ongoing 
global fight to combat both Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
1.1 
The initial National Risk Assessment that was concluded in 2016 reviewed the structures in place for the 
criminalisation of TF and the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.  
Recommendations were made for legislative improvements and for proper training of LEAs and CAs in 
detecting, investigating and prosecuting TF.  Building on the NRA, this assessment delves into the 
assessment of TF risk at a sectoral level further addressing any perceived gaps from the previous NRA.   
 
1.2 
The assessment has taken a critical look at the level of exposure to TF and TF related activities at both a 
domestic and international level, focusing on trade and fund flows generally, and homing in on the 
activities of each relevant sector that may elevate their exposure to misuse for TF purposes. The 
assessment was jointly conducted by the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Investigation 
Agency.  It covers the vulnerabilities within three main areas: the financial services sector which comprises 
the banking, money services, insurance, TCSP, investment business, financing and insolvency sectors; the 
designated non-financial businesses and professions sector which comprises the accounting, legal, 
notarial, real estate, jewellery and other high value goods dealers; and the non-profit organisations sector.

National Threats 
 
1.4 
The threat of TF is of particular importance given the Virgin Islands’ standing as an International Finance 
Centre and the use of BVIBCs and other legal arrangements to facilitate business globally.  The global 
nature of such business makes these structures susceptible to misuse for illicit purposes.  Reported 
instances of TF associated with BVI structures have been very few during the reporting period, which 
covered 2015 to 2019. However, given the large number of BVIBCs and other legal arrangements 
operating in and from within the Virgin Islands the threat of misuse of these entities internationally is 
considered to be greater than at the domestic level. 
 
1.5 
At the domestic level, there are no known terrorist groups, organisations and/or terrorist fighters or self-
radicalised terrorists operating in or targeting the Virgin Islands.  Labour force data does indicate, 
however, that during the reporting period a number of persons from several Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions 
(as defined in the Methodology and outlined in paragraph 6.6) were granted authorisation to reside in the 
Territory for work purposes.  To date, there has not been any information or intelligence provided to 
suggest potential funding of overseas terrorist organisations by individuals resident in the Territory. 
 
1.6 
The VI’s main industries are tourism and financial services.  It carries out little to no manufacturing or 
agricultural activities at any significant scale and is not a significant exporter of locally manufactured 
goods.  Conversely, because the VI is not a large-scale producer of goods it is heavily dependent on 
imports.  There is no indication, however, of any level of direct engagement with any high-risk country as 
a result of the importation of goods into the Territory.   
 
1.7 
Internationally, a significant number of BVIBCs do engage in import/export and other trading related 
activities.   Consequently, there is an elevated risk of these entities having direct engagement with some 
of the jurisdictions categorised as high-risk, or being used, whether knowingly or unknowingly, to finance 
or facilitate the financing of terrorist activities. 
 
1.8 
The general threat of funds generated in the VI being used to finance terrorist operations within the VI is 
low.  Remittance payments indicate that funds generated in the VI have been transmitted to a number of 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions.  However, the data has not yielded any evidence that any funds generated 
in the VI were used to support or finance terrorist activities.  Where the threat level becomes slightly 
elevated is in relation to activities carried out by the BVIBCs registered in the VI that conduct business 
globally.  The rationale being that it is possible that these BVIBCs and other available financial products 
may be used to route funds to terrorist organisations.  However, during the reporting period reported 
instances of TF associated with BVI structures have been limited.   
 
Inherent TF Risk at the Sectoral Level 
1.9 
The banking sector in the Virgin Islands is small in comparison to other similar jurisdictions.  However, the 
sector plays an integral part within the local financial services sector, with operations at both the domestic 
and international levels.  Exposure to criminality within the banking sector comes from the universal 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |6 of 46 
 
nature of retail banking transactions, as well as the frequency and speed with which they are conducted.  
However, the volume of activities involving high-risk jurisdictions is small and are not conducted on a 
regular basis.  Further, exposure to high-risk customers and PEPs is highly localised to those types of 
customers resident in the Territory.  There is some risk of international exposure due to the provision of 
services to non-resident clients, many of whom may be legal persons and legal arrangements.    
 
1.10 While the money services sector itself is small in terms of number of participants, it is significant in terms 
of outflows, as it accounts for a large volume of cross-border transactions.  The core markets for MSBs 
are emigrant workers repatriating funds to their home countries, and residents sending money abroad 
primarily for business and educational support purposes.  While remittance payments data does indicate 
that funds generated in the VI have been transmitted to some Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions, there is no 
evidence that any of these funds were used to support or finance foreign terrorist activities.  Rather, the 
jurisdictions in question equate to the country of origin of the migrant workers who tend to repatriate 
funds to their home countries to support their families.    
 
1.11 The insurance sector in the VI comprises primarily of domestic and captive insurance business.  It also 
includes intermediaries such as managers, brokers, and agents as well as loss adjusters.  The products and 
services offered through domestic insurance companies and intermediaries are limited to life and health 
insurance, and property and casualty insurance business.   These products are not seen as likely vehicles 
for the movement of terrorist-related funds.  With regard to captive insurance providers, given the nature 
and the way in which they operate they are internationally considered low risk institutions.  Further, there 
is no significant level of business relationships with any of the identified Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries.   
 
1.12 Based on nature and activity, it is recognised that the greatest risk of TF lies within the TCSP sector, which 
serves as the primary gateway to the Virgin Islands’ international financial services sector.  The complex 
corporate and legal structures facilitated by TCSPs, as well as other services provided, make these 
structures attractive to both legitimate and illegitimate activity.  This attraction may be elevated due to 
the high level of non-face to face transactions, and the potential for these structures to be used to conceal 
the source of assets and the identity of BOs.  Given the size of the client base of the Territory’s TCSP sector, 
the risk of misuse of such structures for TF purposes is considered more elevated than in other sectors. 
 
1.13 The complex nature of the products offered by the investment business sector makes them attractive to 
high-risk customers, including PEPs and other high net worth individuals.  However, these products are 
not generally attractive vehicles for providing financing to terrorist organisations, although the risk 
remains given the nature of the products.  Most service providers reside outside the VI and are 
geographically dispersed providing for a high level of non-face to face business.  The sector’s diverse 
international client base increases the potential for exposure to some Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries.  This, 
however, does not inherently indicate a higher risk of TF. 
 
1.14 With regard to financing business, the services provided are currently limited to the provision of small, 
short term loans to connected persons or payment plans for insurance premiums.  Further, services are 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |7 of 46 
 
offered to residents on a face-to-face basis, and do not involve clients from any Tier 1 or Tier 2 
jurisdictions.   
 
1.15 Similarly, the general nature of insolvency business not being on-going business makes the risk of the 
sector being used for any TF purposes extremely miniscule.   
 
1.16 The vulnerability in respect of accountants stems from the businesses they provide services to.  The types 
of customers served by this sector are generally corporate and business clients, and high net worth 
individuals, with the majority of the work being undertaken for corporate clients.  However, there is no 
evidence to suggest any terrorist financing links within this sector, particularly in relation to those firms 
that are entirely domestically focused.   
 
1.17 As with accountants, the vulnerability within the legal sector also stems from the businesses to which 
services are provided; a significant number of such services being provided almost exclusively non-face-
to-face.  The majority of the work undertaken by this sector relates to corporate clients based in the US, 
UK, China, Hong Kong, Russia and the BVI.  Data reviewed indicates that some law firms have provided 
services to clients classified as PEPs or based in high-risk jurisdictions. However, the number of 
transactions where this has been the case is low when compared to the total number of transactions 
undertaken by these firms.  There is no evidence to suggest any terrorist financing links within this sector.   
 
1.18 Notaries in the VI are required to be practicing lawyers in accordance with the Commissioners for Oaths 
and Notaries Public Act, 2007.  Issues relative to notaries, therefore, mirror those outlined in relation to 
lawyers.  There is no data to support any risk of TF by notaries in relation to either foreign or domestic 
terrorist activities.   
 
1.19 With regard to real estate agents, transactions involved local properties and properties located in other 
jurisdictions. The data collected shows that most sales were in relation to local residential properties and 
land, with a very small percentage of commercial property sales also occurring.  As noted, some entities 
do undertake non-face-to-face transactions involving properties outside of the Territory, but these were 
found to be predominantly based in the US.  Given the localised nature of the market and the lack of any 
identifiable domestic terrorist activity the risk of the sector being used for any TF purposes is low.    
 
1.20 There are very few DPMS within the Territory.  Those that do exist, concentrate on the sale of finished 
pieces, almost exclusively on a face-to-face basis.  They do not focus on the sale of raw stones, gems or 
bullion, which, based on international typologies are more attractive means of raising terrorist funds.  
There have been no suspected cases of TF involving DPMS, nor any other indications of any TF activity 
within the sector. This is consistent with the makeup of the sector and the general profile of the businesses 
and their customers.  
 
1.21 The majority of NPOs within the sector have been long established, approximately 95% of whom carry out 
their activities solely within the Territory.  Cash and donation activity varies; however, donations generally 
come in the form of cash, cheques or wire transfer.  A considerable number of NPOs operating within the 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |8 of 46 
 
Territory are considered “small” and do not receive donations above $10,000.  During the hosting of 
events certain larger NPOs have been known to collect significant amounts of funding, contributed for 
specific philanthropic purposes.  These are all inbound donations, many of the larger of which are made 
via payments methods (e.g. cheques or wire transfers) utilising the banking and other systems that would, 
therefore, already have been subject to AML/CFT requirements.  While NPOs may generally be vulnerable 
to being used for TF purposes through affiliation (i.e. via connection with an organisation situated or 
working in an area with an active terrorist or TF threat, or knowingly or unknowingly being connected to 
a terrorist organisation), there is no evidence to indicate that any affiliations with international 
organisations are being used to foster TF through NPOs within the Territory.  There is also no evidence to 
indicate that local NPOs supporting charities abroad have unwittingly sent funds to sham NPOs with 
terrorist connections.   
 
1.22 With regard to VA and VASPs, in the context of the VI, unregulated BVIBCs operating globally do pose an 
inherent risk, as these entities may, and do, operate as VA exchanges and ICOs.  The VI’s vulnerability 
exists primarily in that the majority of transactions carried out are on a non-face-to-face basis, which 
offers a higher degree of anonymity than traditional non-cash payment methods.  Further, VASPs may 
also include transfers that are anonymous or pseudo-anonymous, making it difficult to identify 
beneficiaries of the transactions, thereby elevating the risk above other existing FIs.   
 
1.23 The Territory’s overall TF risk was determined based on the impact of the TF threats emanating from both 
domestic and foreign activities, taking into account all of the vulnerabilities identified within each 
identified sector.  Given the Territory’s position as an IFC, the impact of foreign criminality on the overall 
risk level was considered more severe based on the potential of BVI registered entities being used to 
facilitate TF, and the scope of the impact of this conduct.  The threat of TF for the purposes of supporting 
foreign terrorist activity was assessed as Medium-Low.  The domestic TF threat was considered Low.

2. INTRODUCTION  
 
Jurisdictional Profile 
 
Geographical  
2.1 
The Virgin Islands is an archipelago of some sixty (60) islands which sit to the north of the Leeward Islands 
and lie approximately 110 miles west of St. Maarten, a few miles east of the USVI and some 60 miles east 
of Puerto Rico.  It consists of approximately sixty islands, islets and cays, twenty of which are inhabited.  
The islands are primarily volcanic in nature, with the exception of Anegada, which is the most northerly 
of the islands and is constituted of coral and limestone.  The geographical composition and location of the 
islands brings with it inherent risks of people smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal movement of goods 
which have the potential to increase the Territory’s risk of money laundering (ML).  The threat of domestic 
terrorism, however, has historically been very low.   
 
Political 
2.2 
The Territory is classified by the United Nations as a Non-self-governing Territory of the United Kingdom.  
However, the Territory is internally self-governing, and operates under the Westminster system with a 
Cabinet style government.  The Ministers of Cabinet are appointed from amongst the members of the 
Legislature and are not independently elected to executive office.  Ultimately, they are accountable to the 
Parliament.  The Virgin Islands’ Parliament consists of thirteen elected members, the Attorney General 
and a non-elected Speaker selected by the elected members of the House.   
 
2.3 
Historically, the Virgin Islands has had a relatively low crime rate and is politically stable. 
 
Socio-economic  
2.4 
The population of the Virgin Islands is approximately 32,000 and the Territory is home to residents from 
over 110 different countries and territories who make up approximately 70% of the local labour force.  
The official currency of the Territory is the US dollar.1 The primary sectors of the economy which generate 
the most economic activity and revenue are tourism and financial services, with financial services 
contributing approximately 22.6% of the Territory’s GDP. The Virgin Islands’ economic performance is 
reflected by an increase in positive growth of the Territory’s GDP from $1.02 billion in 2014 to $1.30 billion 
in 2019.  However, the current global coronavirus pandemic is likely to have some negative impact on 
performance and growth, particularly given the total closure of the tourism sector for most of the fiscal 
year 2020. 
 
The Assessment 
2.5 
The 2016 NRA covered the period 2011 to 2014 and focused primarily on the implementation of the 
relevant TF related UN Security Council Resolutions by the Territory, and the corresponding level to which 
the Territory has been able to criminalise TF.  That NRA also included an initial TF risk assessment, which 
 
1 This is by virtue of the Legal Tender (Adoption of United States Currency) Act (Cap. 102) of the Laws of the Virgin Islands. 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |10 of 46 
 
noted that the shortcomings found in relation to the LEAs, CAs, FIs, NPOs and DNFBPs would indicate that 
there could be some risk of TF activity occurring without detection because of the low level of training in 
detecting, investigating and prosecuting TF activity2.  
 
2.6 
This assessment now takes a more comprehensive look at the Territory’s TF risk profile resulting from 
data collected for the years 2015 to 2019.  This assessment builds on the findings of the initial NRA as well 
as other CFT related measures taken by the Territory since that time, and considers mechanisms in place 
for addressing TF risks, particularly in high-risk sectors such as NPOs.    
 
2.7 
The assessment was carried out jointly by the FSC and the FIA and involved the following stakeholders: 
• 
The British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission – Regulator/Supervisor of FIs 
• 
The British Virgin Islands Financial Investigation Agency – Financial Intelligence Unit/Supervisor of 
DNFBPs and NPOs 
• 
The Royal Virgin Islands Police Force – Criminal Investigations 
• 
Office of the Governor – International Sanctions  
• 
Attorney General’s Chambers – Mutual Legal Assistance 
• 
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions – Criminal Prosecutions 
• 
HM Customs – Import/Export of Goods and Border Security  
• 
Department of Immigration – Migration Flows 
• 
Department of Labour and Workforce Relations – National Labour Composition  
 
2.8 
The data used in conducting this risk assessment has been determined through interrogation of the 
requirements under the FATF Standards, the results of the Virgin Islands’ 2016 National Risk Assessment, 
and other best practice models.  The assessment looked not only at data available to measure the level of 
international exposure to TF as a result of the Territory’s position as an IFC, but also at other critical 
economic and crime data that were key to properly identifying the level of domestic TF risk posed to the 
VI.

• 
Available macro-fiscal data 
• 
FSC supervisory and inspection data

3. METHODOLOGY 
 
3.1 
In carrying out this exercise the jurisdiction was assessed based on the following identified areas of 
vulnerability taking into consideration the threat environment and the potential consequences of such 
vulnerabilities going undetected and unmitigated:   
 
a) Structural elements: the extent to which elements such as the rule of law, national counter 
terrorism and TF strategies and activities, and frameworks for relationships with regional 
partners exist.  
 
b) Materiality: extent to which the Territory is a financial hub, relative importance of different 
parts of the economy; the extent to which the economy is cash based/unregulated; the 
importance of financial and non-financial sectors which have been highlighted in international 
typologies as higher risk for TF; cultural links and society demographics etc.  
 
c) Sector or product-specific TF vulnerabilities: extent to which products or services have been 
misused in known domestic or international typologies; the level of TF awareness and 
compliance within sectors, and the relative complexity and reach of money movement 
through sub-sectors or firms that may be at higher risk for TF i.e. the manner in which funds 
move around and through sub-sectors and between firms, and how far within the global 
economy such funds can be dispersed.   
 
d) Compliance with FATF Standards relevant to TF: extent to which the legal framework 
provides for the TF offence and implementation/management of Targeted Financial Sanctions 
(TFS), preventive measures, cross-border controls, LEA powers and expertise, and TF 
information exchange in accordance with FATF standards.  
 
e) Effectiveness of AML/CFT regime and other weaknesses: extent to which authorities have 
the capacity to identify and prevent TF; effectiveness of TF-related suspicious transaction 
reporting, monitoring and analysis; quality of intelligence; effectiveness of international CFT 
cooperation; adequacy of human resources; and timely access to beneficial ownership 
information.  
 
3.2 
A numerical rating between 1 and 4, with 1 signifying lowest risk and 4 signifying highest risk, was assigned 
to each of the five criteria based on the inherent vulnerability to the particular criteria.  The sum of these 
individual ratings determined the total vulnerability rating, which could range between a minimum of five 
(5) and a maximum of twenty (20).  This numerical rating determined the jurisdiction’s vulnerability 
classification as follows: 
Scale 
a) High 
 
 
17 - 20 
b) Medium High 
 
13 - 16

c) Medium Low 
 
  9 - 12 
d) Low 
 
 
  5 - 8 
 
3.3 
The level of each of the following controls in place to mitigate against the identified vulnerabilities was 
used to off-set these vulnerabilities:   
 
1) Knowledge of AML/CFT obligations 
2) Prior risk assessment rating 
3) Risk mitigation policies and procedures in place 
4) Level of inter-agency training, coordination and information sharing 
5) Level of maintenance of BO information 
 
3.4 
Similarly to the vulnerability criteria, each of the five (5) mitigating criteria was assigned a rating between 
0 and 2, with 0 indicating a low level of mitigation control measures and 2 indicating a high level of 
mitigation control measures.  The sum of these individual ratings determined the total controls rating, 
which could range between a minimum of zero (0) and a maximum of ten (10).  This numerical rating 
determined the sector’s mitigating classification as follows: 
Scale 
a) High 
 
 
9 - 10 
b) Medium High 
 
6 - 8 
c) Medium Low 
 
3 - 5 
d) Low 
 
 
0 - 2 
 
3.5 
The total controls rating was then subtracted from the total vulnerability rating to determine the overall 
TF risk rating.  The following point value scales were then applied to determine the overall risk rating: 
 
 
Scale

Rationale 
a) 
15 -20

c) 
 1 - 7 
Medium Low 
low vulnerability/low mitigating controls 
d) 
-5 - 0

3.6 
The resulting risk rating for each sector of either Low, Medium Low, Medium High or High as outlined in 
Charts 3.1 and 3.2 below, was based on the average net score received after applying the mitigating 
controls to offset the identified vulnerabilities as detailed in Tables 3.1 and 3. 2.

Additionally, the methodology was modified to take into account the risk of TF from both a domestic and 
international perspective.  The reason for this is due to the BVI’s position as a significant IFC, which in itself 
carries its own additional risk factors.  Charts 3.3 and 3.4 outline the domestic and international TF risk 
ratings assigned to the financial institutions, and DNFBPs and NPOs respectively.

4. THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
4.1 
Terrorist Financing is criminalized in the Virgin Islands through the following Orders-in-Council, which are 
imperial legislation extended to the Territory by the United Kingdom.   
 
• 
Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order, 2001 - prohibits the raising of 
funds for purposes of terrorism and places restrictions on making funds available and providing 
financial services to terrorists. It creates a regime that allows for the disclosure of information, on 
the authority of the Governor, to the United Nations and any government of a country for the 
purpose of detecting evasion of measures relative to terrorism. 
 
• 
Anti-terrorism (Financial and Other Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order, 2002 - restricts 
transactions in terrorist property and creates extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of offences 
relative to terrorism such as engaging in fundraising or money laundering, using or possessing 
property or arranging fundraising activities, for terrorist purposes.  It also enables the registration 
and enforcement of foreign confiscation orders by an order of the Governor, and provides measures 
for the enforcement of forfeiture orders in relation to:  
• 
money or other property which is likely to be used for the purposes of terrorism;  
• 
proceeds of the commission of acts of terrorism; and  
• 
proceeds of acts carried out for the purposes of terrorism.   
 
• 
Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010 (Overseas Territories) Order, 2011 (as amended) - extends 
Part 1 (including Part 1 of Schedule 2) of the United Kingdom’s Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 
2010 to the Territory and replaces the existing power that the Territory has to freeze the assets of 
those suspected of being involved in terrorism under the 2001 Order. 
 
4.2 
In addition, the Afghanistan (United Nations Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order, 2012 and the ISIL 
(Da’esh) and Al-Qaida (Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order, 2016 give effect to the UNSCRs which 
impose targeted financial sanctions against the Taliban, Al-Qaida and ISIL (Da’esh).  They enable relevant 
authorities to take the necessary action to freeze funds of designated persons and entities in respect of 
targeted individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with the Taliban, ISIL and Al-Qaida, and 
prohibit funds being made available to such persons. The 2016 order also prohibits the supply of military 
goods and technical assistance related to military activities to designated persons. 
 
4.3 
At the time of writing, the Territory was in the process of finalising a draft Counter Terrorism Bill, which 
when enacted would serve as the primary legislation under which terrorism and terrorism financing 
offences, inter alia, would be criminalised within the Virgin Islands. 
 
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |17 of 46 
 
5. CFT OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK  
 
5.1 
In the Virgin Islands the responsibility for identifying, monitoring, investigating, prosecuting and providing 
mutual legal assistance and other forms of international cooperation on TF related matters spans across 
the following CAs and LEAs.   
 
a) AGC  –  primary authority responsible for receipt and actioning of MLA requests and other forms 
of international cooperation relative to civil and criminal matters 
b) FIA  –  supervisory authority for NPOs and DNFBPs.  Serves as the national intelligence unit for 
the receipt and analysis of SARs and dissemination of intelligence to local and foreign 
counterparts. Assists the AGC in the provision of information in response to MLA requests 
c) FSC  – regulatory authority responsible for the supervision of FIs including monitoring and 
enforcement of regulatory obligations relative to TFS.  Provides international cooperation 
assistance to foreign counterparts in concurrence with established MoUs and other 
international obligations 
d) GO  
–   CA responsible for the implementation of financial sanctions measures including the 
issuing, varying and revocation of licences that permit the conduct of activities otherwise 
not permitted under the relevant Orders-in-Council 
e) RVIPF – sole LEA responsible for the investigation of terrorist and TF related activities, and 
development and implementation of the Territory’s Counter-Terrorism strategy.  
f) ODPP –  prosecutorial authority responsible for ensuring swift and proper prosecution of TF and 
other terrorism related matters 
g) HMC  –  primary LEA responsible for the safeguarding of the Territory’s borders (in conjunction 
with the RVIPF and the Immigration Department) against illegal entry, people smuggling 
and human trafficking, and the prevention of importation and/or transhipment of illegal 
weapons and related contraband     
h) ID 
 –  primary LEA responsible for the identification and detention of illegal immigrants, 
prevention of entry of unauthorised persons, and the deportation of persons identified as 
undesirable    
 
5.2 
These agencies work closely together on a bi-lateral and multi-lateral basis and have established MoUs 
that allow for domestic cooperation and the exchange of information on matters relative to TF in addition 
to other ML and sanctions related matters4. A legislative framework is also in place that allows for the 
exchange of information and the provision of mutual legal assistance in international cooperation matters. 
 
 
 
4 A list of MoUs currently in place are set out in Appendix I 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |18 of 46 
 
6. TERRORIST FINANCING OVERVIEW 
 
6.1 
A “terrorist act” is defined by the FATF as any act constituting an offence under a range of widely adopted 
international conventions5.  The FATF further defines terrorist financing as the financing of terrorist acts, 
and of terrorists and terrorist organisations6.  These definitions are aligned with those specified in the 
relevant Orders-in-Council that criminalise terrorism and terrorist financing within the Virgin Islands. 
 
6.2 
As with ML, a jurisdiction’s TF risk is considered to be a function of its TF threats and vulnerabilities.  A 
threat in the TF context, being a person or group of people, object or activity with the potential to cause 
harm to the state, society, economy etc.7, through the raising, moving, storing or using of funds and other 
assets (whether from legitimate or illegitimate sources) for terrorist purposes, if relevant action is not 
taken.   
 
6.3 
The concept of vulnerabilities is closely linked to that of a threat and comprises those things that can be 
exploited by the threat, or that may support or facilitate threat activities. Vulnerabilities are effectively 
those factors that represent weaknesses in the Territory’s AML/CFT system, including features of a 
particular sector, financial product or type of service that make them attractive for TF purposes, and 
covers the broadest areas of the economy.   
TF Threats  
6.4 
The threat of TF is of particular importance given the Virgin Islands’ standing as an International Finance 
Centre and the use of BVIBCs and other legal arrangements to facilitate business globally, as such 
structures are susceptible to misuse for illicit purposes.  Reported instances of TF associated with BVI 
structures, however, have been very few during the reporting period.  The number of SARs received by 
the FIA directly identifying terrorist or TF related activities totaled 21.  These SARs were all associated with 
BVIBCs operating in foreign jurisdictions.  Analysis on nine of these SARs did not reveal anything that 
required further investigation. These SARs were closed, and the information recorded for intelligence 
purposes.  The remaining twelve SARs are still undergoing analysis and investigation. A general 
observation is that the information in these SARs were all filed based on information obtained from an 
electronic online intelligence search tool, whose results were not verified by the reporting entities prior 
to the SARs being filed. This, along with some of the data provided being outdated resulted in poor quality 
SARs, thereby posing a challenge where analysis and investigations are concerned.  
 
6.5 
Further, the RVIPF did not report any TF related investigations, domestic or otherwise during the reporting 
period, which is not unexpected in view of the low level of TF related SARs reported.  However, additional 
training with respect to identification investigation and prosecution of TF related matters for LEAs would 
be beneficial to ensure these agencies fully understand their roles. 
 
 
5 Pg 125, International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation, The FATF 
Recommendations, June 2019 
6 Ibid 
7 Pg 8 FATF Report, Emerging Terrorist Financing Risks, October 2015 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |19 of 46 
 
6.6 
The number of TF related SARs received over the reporting period does not reflect a recognizable threat 
of TF in this area, as these SARs accounted for a mere 0.96% of the 2,396 SARs received by the FIA.  
However, this does not negate the potential of BVIBCs and other vehicles being used to finance terrorist 
activities.  Given the large number of BVIBCs and other legal arrangements operating in and from within 
the Virgin Islands the threat of misuse of these entities is considered to be greater than at the domestic 
level. 
 
6.7 
Exposure to terrorism and TF at a domestic level on the other hand is considered to be low.  There are no 
known terrorist groups, organisations and/or terrorist fighters or self-radicalised terrorists operating in or 
targeting the Virgin Islands.  For the purposes of this assessment, however, a pool of high-risk jurisdictions 
was identified to determine the Territory’s potential level of exposure to these countries based on 
relationships stemming from both domestic and cross-border activities.  These jurisdictions were 
recognised as having either been identified by the FATF as having weak AML/CFT regimes8, are known 
conflict areas, or are subject to UN sanctions.  Also included were those countries that did not appear on 
any of those lists but have ties to the Virgin Islands9 and scored less than 50 on the Global Corruption 
Perceptions Index (GCPI)10.  This resulted in the classification of the following jurisdictions outlined in 
Table 6.1 below as Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions, with Tier 1 jurisdictions posing a higher risk than their 
Tier 2 counterparts:

transactions.  Subsequent to this, a further review of the list of countries was carried out to ensure there 
were no additional anomalies.  
 
Labour   
6.9 
During the reporting period the RVIPF did not record any TF related cases associated with domestic 
activity, nor have there been any reports of radicalisation of persons residing within the VI.  Labour force 
data does indicate, however, that during the period a number of persons from several Tier 1 and Tier 2 
jurisdictions were granted authorisation to reside in the Territory for purposes of work.  While this itself 
is not an indication of any possible TF related activity, authorities should monitor fund flows into these 
jurisdictions and take into account any trends that may develop that might indicate potential funding of 
overseas terrorist organisations.  There has, however, not been any information or intelligence provided 
to suggest any such activity.

annually during the reporting period.

Table 6.2: Work Permits Granted to Citizens of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Jurisdictions: 2015-2019 
Trade - Domestic   
6.11 With regard to trade, the VI’s main industries are tourism and financial services.  It carries out little to no 
manufacturing or agricultural activities at any significant scale and is, therefore, not a significant exporter 
of local goods.  Rather, it serves as a secondary exporter of goods i.e. for goods previously imported and 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |21 of 46 
 
then re-exported.  This mainly occurs in relation to goods imported and purchased by individuals who 
then subsequently export these goods to their home country.  Some reasons for this include lack of 
availability of such goods in the home country, quality of goods and cost.  Goods are primarily exported 
to other Caribbean countries, particularly St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and 
Tobago and Guyana which parallels the distribution of the migrant population in the Territory.  While such 
activity has been linked to a level of drug trafficking, there is no evidence to indicate that such activity is 
linked to any terrorist or TF activities. 
 
6.12 Conversely, because the VI is not a large-scale producer of goods it is heavily dependent on imports.  While 
most goods are imported from the US, the origin of these goods includes some Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries.  
This, however, is no indication of any level of direct engagement with these high-risk countries but rather 
a consequence of the production-distribution chain relative to these products.  The VI does, however, 
receive a large number of varied imports from Tier 2 country Trinidad and Tobago ranging from dry goods, 
to paper and plastic products to medical supplies.  The average annual value of such imports is 
approximately $4.6 million.  Again, such imports are a result of legitimate inter-island trade and there is 
no evidence that payment for such goods is used to finance terrorist activities in that county.  As such, the 
threat of TF from domestic trade activities is considered to be very Low.   
 
Trade - International   
6.13 Most BVIBCs incorporated in the jurisdiction are created for the purposes of cross-border business, 
primarily as entities to hold assets or as vehicles for joint ventures which may be linked to the investment 
sector.  Additionally, a significant number of BVIBCs do engage in import/export and other trading related 
activities these companies operate mainly in major global economies including Asia, South America, 
Europe, North America, and to a lesser extent Africa.  Consequently, there is an elevated risk of these 
entities having direct engagement with some of the jurisdictions categorised as high-risk, or being used, 
whether knowingly or unknowingly, to finance or facilitate the financing of terrorist activities in these or 
other jurisdictions.  Data collected during the assessment exercise, however, was insufficient to quantify 
the level of trade engaged in by these entities or to identify potential trading partners.  Given the global 
nature of such trading activities, however, the threat of TF from such international trade activities is 
considered to be Medium-High.  
 
Collection and Movement of Funds - Domestic 
6.14 There are no known terrorist organisations or individual terrorists operating in the VI and there have been 
no domestic acts of terrorism. There is, therefore, no evidence of financing for specific terrorism or 
terrorist events.  As such, the general threat of funds generated in the VI being used to finance terrorist 
operations within the VI is Low.  Further, there is no evidence of a need for funds generated in a foreign 
jurisdiction to be provided to anyone in the VI to finance such activities domestically. Equally, there is no 
evidence of such use of funds within the local NPO sector as explained in detail in section 10 of this report.  
The risk of foreign financing to support domestic terrorist activities is consequently also Low. 
 
6.15 Remittance payments indicate that funds generated in the VI have been transmitted to a number of Tier 
1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions.  There is no evidence, however, that any funds generated in the VI were used to 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |22 of 46 
 
support or finance terrorist activities outside of the Territory.  Based on labour force data the level of 
remittances to these jurisdictions is commensurate with the current demographic composition of the local 
labour force, as non-resident workers tend to repatriate funds to their home countries to support their 
families.  The average value of outgoing money remittance transactions was $288.00.  As such, this threat 
is also considered to be Low.   
 
6.16 However, there is still a need for on-going public education of the general populace in relation to emerging 
TF methods and trends, which could take advantage of both the local and ex-patriate population’s desire 
to provide legitimate assistance to persons or organisations overseas.  Additionally, training of LEAs in 
these areas is also important. 
 
Collection and Movement of Funds - International 
6.17 Where the threat level becomes slightly elevated is in relation to activities carried out by the BVIBCs 
registered in the VI that conduct business globally.  The inherent vulnerability of such BVIBCs is driven by 
the complexity of the international financial transactions they engage in, which heighten the risk of these 
structures being used to facilitate the financing of terrorism. 
 
6.18 As these multinational entities conduct large scale cross-border transactions on a daily basis, the potential 
for misuse is inherently greater.  The rationale being that it is possible that these BVIBCs and other 
available financial products may be used to route funds to terrorist organisations.  As noted previously, 
however, reported instances of TF associated with BVI structures have been negligible during the 
reporting period.  Nonetheless, irrespective of the number of investigations and TF related SARs recorded, 
given the large number of BVIBCs and other legal arrangements operating in and from within the VI, the 
threat of misuse of these entities is considered to be material, given the potentially extensive impact of 
such activity to the reputation of the jurisdiction.  It is therefore, important that the relevant LEAs receive 
the requisite training to identify TF at the international level. The threat of TF associated with the 
collection and movement of funds on an international level is, therefore, considered to be Medium-High. 
 
TF Risks 
6.19 While the identifiable threats of TF may be low, the risk of TF by and through individuals and entities, 
including financial institutions, residing in, or operating from within the Virgin Islands cannot be 
disregarded.  These risks, along with those found in the domestic non-profit (NPO), and to a lesser extent, 
designated non-financial business (DNFBP) sectors, collectively impact the Virgin Islands’ level of 
effectiveness in combatting TF, and in meeting its obligations relative to FATF standards.   
 
6.20 TF risks posed by the individual sectors under review are discussed in sections 8 to 10 below.  The level of 
risk has been identified based on each sector’s level of exposure to identified vulnerabilities taking into 
consideration the threats to the jurisdiction as identified above, and the extent to which each sector has 
been able to successfully mitigate these vulnerabilities. 
 
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |23 of 46 
 
6.21 The identified vulnerabilities themselves are based, inter alia, on: 
• 
the level of implementation of CT and TF strategies,  
• 
use of the Territory’s international cooperation framework,  
• 
links to high-risk jurisdictions,  
• 
identification of sectors in TF typologies,  
• 
level of compliance with TF requirements including TFS,  
• 
strength of the legal framework to address TF related offences, and 
• 
availability of information to assist in MLA and other international cooperation requests. 
 
6.22 These vulnerabilities have been mitigated to varying levels in most instances through the jurisdiction’s 
level of understanding of TF amongst high-risk sectors, understanding of its CFT obligations relative to the 
maintenance of BO information, level of coordination and information sharing among LEAs, and the 
effectiveness of the sanctions regime currently in place.   
 
6.23 In determining the Territory’s overall TF risk level focus was placed on the major TF threats emanating 
from both domestic and foreign activities and their impact to the Territory.  The domestic TF threat was 
considered Low, while the threat of TF for the purposes of supporting foreign terrorist activity was 
assessed as Medium-Low.  Given the Territory’s position as an IFC, the impact of foreign criminality on 
the overall risk level was considered more severe based on the potential of BVI registered entities being 
used to facilitate TF, and the scope of the impact of this conduct. 
 
7. COOPERATION MATTERS 
International Cooperation 
7.1 
The greater risk of TF for the VI lies with the misuse of legal persons and legal arrangements registered in 
and operating from within the VI.  The ability to provide mutual legal assistance and other forms of 
international cooperation is therefore paramount to the VI’s ability to assist in mitigating such risk.  Formal 
MLA requests are handled through the AGC with assistance from the FIA for those requests where a BVIBC 
or other legal arrangement may be the subject of the enquiry.  In addition, exchange of financial 
intelligence is facilitated through the FIA’s membership in the Egmont Group as well as the Territory’s 
membership in the CFATF, which allows the FIA to utilise information sharing agreements with non-
Egmont members.  The FIA also has the ability to make spontaneous disseminations to other LEAs based 
on intelligence gathering exercises.   
 
7.2 
The RVIPF interacts regularly with its foreign counterparts and has developed strong working relationships 
with regional, US and UK law enforcement authorities which extends to potential matters relating to both 
ML and TF.  HMC has also forged solid working relationships with regional and international counterparts 
through its membership in the WCO and the CCLEC, and works closely with US CBP and ICE.  HMC also has 
the ability to participate in joint operations with these agencies, along with the RVIPF when necessary.  
These relationships ensure that if there is a need for cooperation in relation to a local TF related 
investigation with extra-territorial reach, or an international TF investigation with a domestic link, the 
framework is in place for such cooperation to take place.  
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |24 of 46 
 
 
7.3 
Based on data provided the FIA received seventy-one (71) foreign requests for assistance during the 
reporting period in which TF was identified in the subject matter.  The vast majority of these, (62), were 
recorded in 2019 and were related to requests for BO information of BVIBCs from one UK authority.  
However, the classification of the requests from that particular UK authority was very broad, as all the 
requests identified “corruption, ML, TF, proliferation and organised crime” as the reason for the request, 
which appeared to be a ‘catch-all’ description.  It was, therefore, initially unclear whether the activities 
on which these requests were based, actually involved TF activities.  Nonetheless, the information 
requested was provided in all instances.  Further review of the information provided that the requests for 
information were not related specifically to terrorism or TF offences. This was determined through a 
comparative analysis with the MLA requests received, which showed a correlation with only one of the 
initial UK requests in which terrorism and/or TF was specifically mentioned, as outlined in paragraph 7.4 
below. Therefore, the conclusion is that the requests from the UK authority did not relate specifically to 
terrorism or TF but rather tax related crimes for which they were seeking BO information.  
 
7.4 
The FIA confirmed that during the reporting period they were asked to provide information for only one 
terrorism/TF related MLA request.  This request involved two BVIBCs that were accused of providing 
“material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organisation” in Iraq and Syria.  The request generally 
sought information on the ownership of the companies. The request was fully responded to and the 
information on BO of the companies was provided. Feedback on the usefulness of the information was 
sought, as is standard practice with the FIA. 
 
 
7.5 
On the regulatory side, the FSC is an active member of IOSCO, GIFCS and IAIS, as well as other regional 
associations such as ASBA, CGBS, and CAIR.  Membership in these organisations allows the FSC to facilitate 
international cooperation requests received from member jurisdictions and make requests for 
information, if and when necessary.  During the reporting period the FSC confirmed that it did not receive 
or make any TF related international cooperation requests. 
 
Targeted Financial Sanctions 
7.6 
In order to ensure an effective financial sanctions regime, the VI embraces international standards and 
best-practice standards which promote international cooperation and international security in 
accordance with international agreements. This includes the implementation of measures to ensure that 
it meets its obligations to combat TF as embodied under the FATF Recommendations. 
Example 
Two BVIBCs were accused of providing “material support or resources to a foreign terrorist 
organisation” in Iraq and Syria.  The BVIBCs were linked, together with other ISIS media organisations, 
to social media accounts used to published ISIS related propaganda.  The necessary BO information on 
the BVIBCs was provided by local LEAs, which indicated that the BO was an Iraqi born US citizen.  
Feedback on the usefulness of the information provided was sought, however, no feedback was 
received.

7.7 
As a British Overseas Territory, the VI is committed to ensuring its role in the maintenance of international 
peace and security, and therefore implements the international sanctions obligations extended through 
the UK in the form of Orders-in-Council. The Governor of the Virgin Islands is the CA with responsibility 
for enforcing Orders-in-Council relative to international sanctions.  Through internal processes between 
the GO and the FIA these matters are investigated and responded to in a timely manner.   
 
7.8 
Between 2015 and 2019 BVIBCs were named in relation to 30 potential breaches of UN sanctions relative 
to TF.  In addition, communication regarding additional potential breaches involving 27 BVIBCs was 
received from sources including FIs, DNFBPs and foreign NGOs.  The jurisdictions to which these potential 
breaches and reports relate are outlined in Table 7.1 below:

Requests received by the GO from the UN’s Panels of Experts, which are working groups established by 
the UN to support the work of the various UN Sanctions Committees, are forwarded to the FIA for 
investigation, and results are returned to the GO without exception.  During the reporting period 12 
requests for information in relation to the 30 BVIBCs named were sent to the FIA, all of which were in 
relation to potential breaches of UN sanctions by BVI registered entities.  All requests were responded to 
by the FIA within the desired timeframe, and the resulting findings were communicated to the relevant 
 
11  These 3 companies were named in relation to both Libya and Zimbabwe 
12 Ibid 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |26 of 46 
 
UN Panel of Experts in accordance with the Territory’s commitment to its international cooperation 
obligations.  The jurisdiction has received positive feedback from the UN Panel for its responsiveness to 
their requests. 
 
7.10 With regard to other communication received by the GO from private sector entities, there has been only 
one instance where evidence was found to warrant action being taken.  In this instance, the FIA completed 
an investigation and passed the file to the RVIPF. However, it was deemed by the ODPP that there was no 
legal framework to attempt prosecution in the matter. This is a clear gap in the Virgin Islands’ ability to 
respond effectively to sanctions related matters which needs to be addressed.   
 
7.11 During the reporting period, 51 SARs submitted to the FIA related to possible sanctions offences, including 
alleged sanctions breaches by clients, persons on sanctions lists identified as clients, and clients who may 
have had an association/connection to a sanctioned individual/entity.  The majority of these SARs were 
filed by TCSPs (see Table 7.2 for details).

Table 7.2: Sanctions Related SARs Filings by Sector: 2015-2019 
All of the 51 SARs concerned sanctioned individuals who were identified as BOs, shareholders and/or 
directors of BVIBCs.  However, there were no instances in which BVIBCs themselves were found to have 
breached a UN/EU sanction.  Upon investigation of these SARs, forty-nine of them did not reveal anything 
that required further investigation as no specific sanction breach was identified.  As such, no further action 
was recommended, and they were filed for future reference if needed. One SAR was disseminated to a 
foreign FIU and one to the FSC, both for intelligence purposes.   Prior to the FSC taking action, the RA 
terminated its relationship with the BVIBC in question.  The BVIBC was subsequently struck from the 
Register of Companies.   
 
7.12 Given the sheer volume of BVIBCs this may reflect that generally, BVIBCs are aware of their obligations 
under the various UN/ EU13  sanctions and adhere to the requirements of the sanctions orders, or that 
client onboarding and monitoring procedures of FIs are robust, thereby minimising the number of clients 
from Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions.  Conversely it could point to insufficient monitoring of the perimeter 
to detect the true number of BVIBCs involved in sanctions busting activities or owned by sanctioned 
 
13 As a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on 31 December 2020 EU sanctions are no longer applicable to 
the BVI 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |27 of 46 
 
individuals.  This needs to be carefully considered as it may reflect a potentially higher level of risk to the 
jurisdiction based on exposure to these types of individuals. 
 
7.13 In accordance with the TFS regime the Governor, under the powers conferred by the individual Sanctions 
Orders, is responsible for granting licences to conduct business with or on behalf of a designated person 
or entity.  In considering such licences the GO works closely with the AGC to ensure all applications meet 
the criteria and are properly evaluated.  Between 2015 and 2019 the Governor granted 3 such licenses 
and revoked one.  Two additional licences that were previously granted became invalid as the designated 
person was removed from the relevant sanctions list.  The low number of requests for licenses appears to 
correlate with the low number of instances in which BVIBCs or persons related to BVIBCs have been 
designated. 
 
7.14 Recognising the importance of proper adherence to the sanctions regime, the GO engages in targeted 
outreach to the financial services industry and the public in relation to sanctions mechanisms.  Specifically, 
in 2019 as part of its outreach programme, the GO presented to the Territory’s Association of Compliance 
Officers on its licensing regime and requirements for applying for a licence to conduct business with or on 
behalf of a designated person or entity.  Over one hundred (100) persons attended this training, the focus 
of which was to ensure entities within the financial services sector fully understand their responsibilities 
when dealing with designated persons.  Therefore, the low number of requests for licences is likely an 
indication that industry professionals understand the requirements for seeking a licence.  Additionally, in 
2018 the GO facilitated a sanctions workshop sponsored by OFSI that was geared toward both public and 
private sector entities based in the Territory.  The GO’s presentation focused on licensing as well as 
international cooperation relating to investigations, amongst other things.  Over seventy (70) persons 
participated in that workshop.   
 
Domestic Cooperation 
7.15 The framework used for fostering inter-agency cooperation in the VI includes information exchange based 
on the use of bi-lateral inter-agency MOUs such as those established between the FSC and FIA, FIA and 
HM Customs, and FIA and RVIPF.  Additionally, there is a multi-lateral inter-agency MOU established 
amongst the 18 members of the IGC, which defines the relationship between the members and compels 
them to work together to, inter alia, enhance the Territory’s compliance with its international obligations 
with respect to information exchange, and coordinate activities to effectively combat criminality relative 
to ML, TF, corruption, matters related to organized crime and tax obligations.  
 
7.16 Cooperation amongst these agencies spans the entire gamut of the Virgin Islands’ AML regime.  Of 
particular importance is the relationship between the FIA and the RVIPF in relation to the analysis, 
dissemination and investigation of SAR related activities, as well as the relationship between the RVIPF 
and the ODPP with respect to investigation and prosecution of offences.  Additionally, as noted above, 
the FIA provides valuable support to the AGC in gathering information relating to legal persons and legal 
arrangements established in the VI to allow for the AGC to respond to MLA requests. 
 
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |28 of 46 
 
8. SECTORAL ANALYSIS OF TF RISK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
 
Banking 
8.1 
The banking sector in the VI is small in comparison to other jurisdictions, with only six licensed commercial 
banks and one private wealth management institution, none of which act as a correspondent bank.  The 
sector plays an integral part within the local financial services sector, with operations at both the domestic 
and international levels.  The products and services offered are standard banking related products and 
services and are not of an overly complex nature.   
 
8.2 
Services are provided to non-resident persons either directly or through the provision of banking services 
to legal persons and legal arrangements.  The BOs and other relevant persons of these legal persons and 
legal arrangements are clients of licensed TCSPs.  However, overall, the banking sector within the VI 
predominantly provides banking facilities to residents and local businesses.  To put this into perspective 
the total value of non-resident loans at the end of 2019 was reported at $71.125 million or just over 5% 
of all total loans.  Similarly, non-resident deposits accounted for only 14.2% of all deposits.  While most 
institutions now offer some form of online banking, a vast majority of business is still conducted face-to-
face based on the products and services offered.  Exposure to high-risk customers and PEPs is therefore 
highly localised to those types of customers resident in the Territory.  It is recognised, however, that there 
is some risk of international exposure due to the provision of services to non-resident clients, many of 
whom may be legal persons and legal arrangements.    
 
8.3 
Exposure to criminality within the banking sector comes from the universal nature of retail banking 
transactions, as well as the frequency and speed with which they are conducted.  While there is the 
potential for some of the activities within the sector to involve high-risk jurisdictions, the volume of such 
activities is small and are not conducted on a regular basis.  Cross-border transactions engaged in by the 
banking institutions, based on the value of reported incoming and outgoing wire transfers primarily 
involve transfers to and from North America, Europe (including the UK) and the Caribbean.  There is no 
evidence of any direct link to any Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdiction, with the exception of Trinidad and Tobago.  
However, this is attributed to the trading relationship between Trinidad and Tobago and the Territory.  
Further, there have been no reports of any VI banking institutions being used to facilitate the financing of 
any foreign terrorist activities. 
 
8.4 
The risk of TF in the banking sector in support of foreign terrorism is assessed as Low.  The risk of TF in 
support of domestic terrorist activities is also assessed as Low. 
 
Money Services 
8.5 
There are only 2 licensed MSBs in the VI.  These two entities are part of large international money transfer 
organisations with operations throughout the wider Caribbean region and beyond.  These licensees 
currently provide money transmission services through two branches and three representative offices. 
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |29 of 46 
 
8.6 
The core markets for MSBs within the Virgin Islands are emigrant workers repatriating funds to their home 
countries, and residents sending money abroad primarily for business and educational support purposes.  
Based on labour force data the level of outbound remittances is commensurate with the current 
demographic composition of the local labour force. The top jurisdictions receiving outward transfers are 
the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Guyana.  This is aligned to the size of these immigrant populations 
which rank in the top 5 jurisdictions from which the labour force in the VI is sourced.   
 
8.7 
As noted in section 6 of this report, remittance payments data indicates that funds generated in the VI 
have been transmitted to some Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions.  There is no evidence, however, that any of 
these funds were used to support or finance foreign terrorist activities.  Rather, the jurisdictions in 
question equate to the country of origin of migrant workers who tend to repatriate funds to their home 
countries to support their families.    
 
8.8 
As transactions tend to be one-off, however, there is potentially a higher level of risk associated with the 
verification of BO information, as such verification is generally only conducted on high-risk customers or 
on transactions above the specified threshold amount.  Given that approximately 93% of all transactions 
are outbound, and confirmation of BO information on transactions rests with the local sending party for 
which there is no evidence of radicalisation, the issue of verification does not appear to elevate the risk 
of any possible TF threat. 
 
8.9 
The risk of TF in the MSB sector in regard to support of foreign terrorism is assessed as Medium-Low, 
specifically in the middle of the medium low scale while the risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist 
activities is assessed as Low. 
 
Insurance 
8.10 The insurance sector in the VI comprises primarily of domestic and captive insurance business.  It also 
includes intermediaries such as managers, brokers, and agents as well as loss adjusters.    The products 
and services offered through domestic insurance companies and intermediaries are limited to the 
relatively vanilla type offerings of life and health insurance, and property and casualty insurance business 
which applies mainly to persons and property in the Territory.  These products are not seen as likely 
vehicles for the movement of terrorist-related funds.  Furthermore, most business is conducted through 
face-to-face contact and cash transactions are limited to the payment of premiums by some customers.   
 
8.11 PEPs utilising the products and services offered are generally local PEPs consisting of government officials 
and other individuals holding high level positions in statutory corporations, along with their close 
associates and family members.  It is highly unlikely that any of these persons would have connections to 
foreign terrorist organisations, and given the lack of any known terrorist groups, organisations or self-
radicalised terrorists operating in the Virgin Islands, such connections relative to domestic terrorist activity 
are also highly improbable. 
 
8.12 With regard to captive insurance providers, given the nature and the way in which they operate they are 
internationally considered low risk institutions.  In the VI context, the greater portion of clients serviced 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |30 of 46 
 
by these institutions originate in the US, so the prospect of this sector being used for state sponsored 
terrorism is not likely, as there is no significant level of business relationships with any of the identified 
Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries.   
 
8.13 According to typologies and other international guidance, exposure to TF in the insurance sector comes 
through the provision of kidnap and ransom insurance and potential cyber-attacks.  However, such 
guidance generally indicates that the use of the insurance sector for the purpose of TF is extremely limited.  
None of the insurance licensees within the sector are known to provide kidnap and ransom insurance.   
 
8.14 The risk of TF in support of foreign terrorism is assessed at the lower end of the Medium-Low scale while 
the risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is further assessed as Low. 
 
TCSPs 
8.15 Based on nature and activity, it is recognised that the greatest risk of TF lies within the TCSP sector.  TCSPs 
offer a variety of services which include company administration, accounting services, ship registration, 
trustee and protector services, incorporations through the provision of RA services, and provision of 
directors and nominee shareholder services.  These entities serve as the primary gateway to the Virgin 
Islands’ international financial services sector.   
 
8.16 The complex corporate and legal structures facilitated by TCSPs, as well as other services provided, make 
these structures attractive to high-risk customers, including PEPs and other high net worth individuals 
who are seeking to maximise and protect their assets.  Unfortunately, these characteristics also make 
them attractive to international criminals, including terrorist organisations and financiers who may use 
these structures and services to facilitate the movement of terrorist funds.  This attraction may be 
elevated due to the high level of non-face to face transactions, and the potential for these structures to 
be used to conceal the source of assets and the identity of BOs.  Further, there is also the potential for 
regulatory arbitrage by criminals who may try to take advantage of jurisdictions with lax AML/CFT regimes 
that lend themselves to TCSPs being open to possible bribery and corruption as a means of facilitating the 
movement of funds in support of terrorist activities.    
 
8.17 International guidance confirms the risk of such corporate vehicles being susceptible to misuse for TF 
purposes.  According to the 2006 FATF publication The Misuse of Corporate Vehicles, Including Trust and 
Company Service Providers, “Corporate entities, including corporations, trusts, foundations and 
partnerships with limited liability characteristics, …may under certain conditions, be used for illicit 
purposes, including money laundering, bribery and corruption, improper insider dealings, tax fraud, 
financing of terrorist activities and other forms of illegal activities”14. 
 
8.18 Additional guidance from the FATF also indicates that the services and products available through the 
formal financial sector pose significant risk as they may serve as vehicles for moving funds that support 
 
14 Pg 1 The Misuse of Corporate Vehicles, Including Trust and Company Service Providers, Financial Action Task 
Force, 13 October 2006 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |31 of 46 
 
terrorist organisations and fund acts of terrorism15.   It is for this reason, given the size of the client base 
of the Territory’s TCSP sector, that the risk of misuse of such vehicles for TF purposes is considered more 
elevated than in other sectors. 
 
8.19 At the end of 2019 there were 258 licensed TCSPs providing services to 387,344 active clients (i.e. in good 
standing and in compliance with the BVIBCA).  Clients of TCSPs comprise persons that are resident and 
non-resident in the Territory, with the latter constituting the vast majority of these clients.  Non-resident 
clients emanate geographically from most major global economies including those in Asia, South America, 
Europe, North America, and to a lesser extent Africa.   Data provided indicates that some TCSPs do provide 
services to clients operating in Tier 2 countries.  
 
8.20 As indicated in section 6, there were 21 SARs submitted to the FIA during the reporting period relating to 
any potential TF activity.  Of these 21 SARs, 11 were filed by TCSPs while 9 were received directly from 
one BVIBC which appears to be engaged in VA and VASP type activities.  The one remaining SAR was 
received from a BVI law firm.  Of the 11 SARs filed by TCSPs, eight did not reveal anything that required 
further investigation.  These SARs were closed, and the information recorded for future intelligence 
purposes.  These SARs, along with the one SAR received from the BVI law firm were closed, and the 
information recorded for future intelligence purposes.  The remaining three SARs filed by TCSPs, along 
with the nine received from the BVIBC are still undergoing analysis and investigation.  Further, only one 
TF related MLA request was received in which a BVIBC serviced by a TCSP was the subject.  Information 
was provided by the TCSP to the FIA, which enabled the AGC to respond to the request in a timely manner.  
 
8.21 With regard to trusts, these products have characteristics that attract use from high-risk persons, including 
PEPs.  Furthermore, the very nature of the trusts means that they are attractive to high net-worth 
individuals who may emanate from high-risk jurisdictions, for estate planning purposes or protection of 
family assets.  However, there is no evidence that such structures have been identified in any international 
typologies as typical vehicles used by terrorist organisations or sympathisers to facilitate TF.   
 
8.22 Due to the sheer volume of clients serviced by the TCSP sector and the potential for these clients to be 
used to facilitate TF, the risk of TF in support of foreign terrorism is assessed as mid-range Medium-Low.  
Conversely, the risk of TF within the TCSP sector in support of domestic terrorist activities is Low given the 
lack of any known terrorist groups, organisations and/or self-radicalised terrorists operating in or 
targeting the Virgin Islands. 
 
Investment Business 
8.23 The complex nature of the products offered by the investment business sector makes them attractive to 
high-risk customers, including PEPs and other high net worth individuals.  Products and services offered 
include FOREX, cryptocurrencies, commodities, bonds, equities, fund administration services, insurance 
products, custodial services, mutual funds, segregated portfolios, and closed ended funds.  Some entities 
operate online platforms for trading which can be accessed worldwide. These products, however, are not 
 
15 Pg 21 FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report, February 2008 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |32 of 46 
 
generally attractive vehicles for providing financing to terrorist organisations, although the risk remains 
given the nature of the products. 
 
8.24 Due to the nature of investment business, there is generally a high level of non-face to face business.  
Most service providers reside outside the VI and are geographically dispersed. The sector’s diverse 
international client base means that these entities hold substantial foreign portfolio holdings, primarily in 
the Asian-Pacific countries, North America, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Middle East, and Africa.  
There is potential, therefore, for exposure to some Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries.  This, however, does not 
inherently indicate a higher risk of TF. 
 
8.25 Generally, the client profile for investment schemes does not correspond to the profile of terrorist 
organisations or other radicalised individuals.  Further, the investment business sector has not been 
identified as being particularly vulnerable to TF based on typology reports and other guidance provided 
by the international community.    
 
8.26 The risk of TF within this sector in relation to support of foreign terrorism is, therefore, assessed at the 
lower end of the Medium-Low range.  Further, the risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is 
assessed as Low. 
 
Other Financial Services (Financing Business and Insolvency Services) 
8.27 Since the coming into force of the FMSA, only three Financing Business licences have been issued.  All 
three licensees are relatively small with client bases that are generally connected, such as employees.  The 
services provided are currently limited to the provision of small, short term loans to connected persons 
or payment plans for insurance premiums.  Further, services are offered to residents on a face-to-face 
basis, and do not involve clients from any Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdictions.  High-risk customers and PEPs 
utilising these services are all domestic in nature.   
 
8.28 With regard to insolvency services, appointments may involve businesses operating in high-risk 
jurisdictions and the potential for non-face-to-face business.  Further, the client base may include 
international PEPs and businesses operating in high-risk jurisdictions.  However, the general nature of 
insolvency business not being on-going business makes the risk of the sector being used for any TF 
purposes extremely miniscule.   
 
8.29 The risk of TF in these sectors in regard to support of foreign terrorism is assessed as Low.  Equally, the 
risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is assessed as Low. 
 
 
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |33 of 46 
 
9. SECTORAL ANALYSIS OF TF RISK OF DESIGNATED NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND 
PROFESSIONS 
 
Accountants 
9.1 
There are a small number of accountants operating within the Territory that, based on their activities, fall 
to be monitored for AML/CFT purposes.  Most accounting firms form part of larger international firms 
with established business relationships across the globe.  The sector is supervised by the FIA and is subject 
to comprehensive AML/CFT requirements.  As with all FIs and DNFBPs, accountants are required to file 
SARs with the FIA. 
 
9.2 
The vulnerability in respect of accountants stems from the businesses they provide services to.  Similar to 
lawyers, the types of customers served by this sector are generally corporate and business clients, and 
high net worth individuals, with the majority of the work being undertaken for corporate clients. 
 
9.3 
Lack of data made it difficult to determine whether some entities have provided services to clients 
classified as PEPs or based in high-risk jurisdictions. However, from what was provided there is no 
evidence to suggest any terrorist financing links within this sector, particularly in relation to those firms 
that are entirely domestically focused, given the established jurisdictional profile.   
 
9.4 
The risk of TF in the accountant sector in regard to support of foreign terrorism is, therefore, assessed as 
mid-range Medium-Low.  The risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is assessed as Low. 
 
Lawyers 
9.5 
As with accountants and other DNFBPs, lawyers fall under the supervisory remit of the FIA if they engage 
in any of the core activities identified in the AMLR.  Most qualifying entities are established global law 
firms who have long-standing offices in the Territory.  These firms provide services internationally and 
usually have global compliance systems in place to ensure their compliance with AML/CFT regulatory 
requirements. In most cases, the compliance functions are also conducted by the regional or international 
compliance teams.  During the reporting period one TF related SAR was filed by a BVI law firm.  Upon 
review by the FIA however, nothing was found that required further investigation. The SAR was closed, 
and the information recorded for future intelligence purposes by the FIA. 
 
9.6 
The vulnerability within this sector also stems from the businesses to which services are provided, a 
significant number of such services being provided almost exclusively on a non-face-to-face basis.  The 
types of customers that are served by this sector are also high net worth individuals, and corporate and 
business clients, with the majority of work being undertaken for corporate clients.  Most of these are 
based in the US, UK, China, Hong Kong, Russia and the BVI.  The size and value of transactions undertaken 
by these firms varies depending on the work undertaken, the type of entity, and in actuality, the 
transaction itself.  Given the nature of these transactions, payments received or made are usually done 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |34 of 46 
 
via wire transfers. The level of actual cash used for this purpose is little to none.  While the size of these 
transactions is significant, this in and of itself is not indicative of any elevated TF risk.  
 
9.7 
The data received shows that some law firms have provided services to clients classified as PEPs or based 
in high-risk jurisdictions. However, the number of transactions where this has been the case is low when 
compared to the total number of transactions undertaken by these firms.  There is no evidence to suggest 
any terrorist financing links within this sector.   
 
9.8 
The risk of TF in the legal sector in regard to support of foreign terrorism is assessed as Low.  Equally, the 
risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is assessed as Low. 
 
Notaries 
9.9 
One of the criteria for persons wishing to serve as a notary in the VI is the requirement to be a practicing 
lawyer within the Territory in accordance with the Commissioners for Oaths and Notaries Public Act, 2007 
unless special dispensation is granted by the Chief Justice otherwise.  As such, the issues relative to 
notaries would mirror those outlined in relation to lawyers above.  There is no data to support any risk of 
TF by notaries in relation to either foreign or domestic terrorist activities.   
 
9.10 The assessment of TF risk in relation to notaries is Low in relation to foreign terrorism.  Likewise, risk of 
TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is also assessed as Low.  
 
Real Estate Agents 
9.11 Entities within this sector engage in the business of buying and selling real estate, providing residential 
and commercial rentals, and property management services. For the purposes of this assessment, 
however, the focus has been given solely to the buying and selling element, as per the FATF 
Recommendations.  
 
9.12 The majority of clients served by this sector are individuals, approximately 10% of which are HNIs, with 
another 10% being corporate clients.  Most real estate sales were found to be in relation to local 
residential properties and land sales, with a very small percentage of commercial sales also occurring.  
However, some entities do undertake non-face-to-face transactions involving properties outside of the 
Territory and these were found to be predominantly based in the US.  
 
9.13 In the course of a transaction REAs generally receive or pay out funds.  The main payment methods are 
split between wire transfers and cheques. The size and value of transactions vary from entity to entity, 
depending on their areas of focus as well as the market. The approximate value of annual residential sales 
transactions during the reporting period ranged from $3 million to $10 million, while annual land sales 
transactions ranged from $200,000 to $2 million.  The size of these transactions, however, is not indicative 
of any elevated TF risk.  
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |35 of 46 
 
9.14 Due to this sector’s limited understanding of TF risk, minimal risk mitigation policies and sanctions 
monitoring frameworks, the risk of TF in support of foreign terrorist activities has been assessed on the 
lower end of the Medium-High scale. However, given that the market predominantly deals with clients 
based on the Virgin Islands, and the lack of any identifiable domestic terrorist activity the risk of TF in 
support of domestic terrorism is assessed as Low. 
 
Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones (Jewellers) 
9.15 Dealers in precious metals and stones (DPMS) by their very nature operate a high value business, engaging 
in both purchase and sale of these commodities.  There are only two DPMS within the Territory, and these 
entities concentrate primarily on the sale of finished pieces, almost exclusively on a face-to-face basis, 
and not the sale of raw stones, gems or bullion, which, based on international typologies are more 
attractive means of raising terrorist funds.  They, therefore, are classified as jewellers under the Non-
financial Business (Designation) Notice, 2008. 
 
9.16 With the BVI being a high tourism destination, many visitors to the Territory purchase jewellery during 
their stay. These visitors are primarily from the US and Europe and all business in this sector is carried out 
face to face. There have been no suspected cases of TF involving DPMS, nor any other indications of any 
TF activity within the sector. This is consistent with the makeup of the sector and the general profile of 
the businesses and their customers.  
 
9.17 The risk of TF within this sector in relation to support of foreign terrorism is assessed at the higher end of 
the Medium-Low scale.  The risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is assessed as Low. 
 
Other High Value Goods Dealers  
9.18 Under the Non-financial Business (Designation) Notice, 2008, persons who engage in buying and selling 
certain high value goods where the transaction involves acceptance of cash payments of $15,000 or more 
are subject to AML/CFT supervision by the FIA.  The categories of HVGs under the Notice include: 
• 
Boat (yacht) dealers 
• 
Vehicle dealers 
• 
Jewellers 
• 
Furniture, machinery, and art dealers 
 
9.19 Machinery and art dealers have been excluded from this assessment as they are a very insignificant sector 
and have been deemed to present no ML/TF risk.  Jewellers have been addressed in the assessment of 
DPMS under the DNFBP section. 
 
9.20 With regard to yacht brokers and dealers, while the yachting industry within the BVI is significant, the 
number of entities involved in the business of buying and selling of boats is considerably small.  The clients 
served by this sector range from individuals to businesses and corporate clients.  During the course of a 
normal transaction these broker/dealers transfer funds between a seller and a buyer.  Over 95% of such 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |36 of 46 
 
payments are made by wire transfers.  While the buying and selling of yachts has been identified as a 
potential means of ML, there is no evidence to indicate that this sector has been used to facilitate TF.  
 
9.21 The size of vehicle dealers within the Territory varies. The number of transactions engaged in by these 
businesses also varies as does the average value of the vehicles sold.  This sector does not generally engage 
in the export of vehicles.  In light of this, and given the lack of any known terrorist groups, organisations 
and/or terrorist fighters or self-radicalised terrorists operating in or targeting the Virgin Islands, it is 
difficult to conclude that this sector could be used to finance any domestic or foreign terrorist activity. 
 
9.22 There are very few furniture dealers within the Territory, and as with the vehicle dealers, these entities 
do not generally engage in the export of their merchandise.  The risk of the sector being used for any TF 
purposes is extremely low. 
 
9.23 Overall, the risk of TF within the HVG sector in relation to support of foreign terrorism is assessed at the 
higher end of the Medium-Low scale.  The risk of TF in support of domestic terrorist activities is also 
assessed as Low. 
 
9.24 It should be noted that any elevated level of risk identified within the various DNFBP sub-sectors is as a 
result of the lack of mitigating controls currently in place, more so than actual exposure to TF activities.  It 
is necessary for the FIA as the supervisor, to ensure that all sub-sectors are made aware of their AML/CFT 
obligations and that proper policies and procedures are in place to mitigate any identified risks.  Further, 
outreach should be carried out to promote proper understanding of these obligations by each sub-sector.  
This will aid in reducing the current level of risk. 
 
10. SECTORAL ANALYSIS OF TF RISK OF NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS 
 
10.1 NPOs within the VI must register with the NPO Registration Board in accordance with the Non-profit 
Organisations Act, 2012.  The types of NPOs registered within the VI are varied and include, inter alia, the 
following categories: 
 
• 
Community Organisations  
• 
Religious Organisations  
• 
School Clubs and Associations  
• 
Sporting Associations  
• 
Youth Organisations 
 
10.2 Supervision of the NPO sector is the responsibility of the FIA who works in tandem with the NPO 
Registration Board to ensure all identified NPOs are made aware of their statutory obligations.  
 
10.3 Although a small number of new NPOs are formed annually, the majority of NPOs within the sector have 
been long established.  Of these, approximately 95% carry out their activities solely within the Territory.  
Of the current active NPOs, approximately 50% are categorised as Religious Organisations. The remaining 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |37 of 46 
 
NPOs are a varied mix of the above types of organisations, the main objectives of which are very much 
community focused. 
 
10.4 The cash and donation activity within the sector varies depending on the size and type of NPO. Fund-
raising activity within the sector predominantly occurs via the hosting of events, and receipt of general 
donations.  Donations are generally facilitated through cash, cheques or wire transfer.  A considerable 
number of NPOs operating within the Territory are considered “small” and do not receive donations above 
the $10,000 threshold.  However, for larger NPOs, donation activity does go above the threshold.  During 
the hosting of events certain larger NPOs have been known to receive significant amounts of cash 
contributed for specific philanthropic purposes.  Additionally, some sporting organisations receive grants 
from global organisations with which they are affiliated e.g. International Federation of Association 
Football (FIFA) or the International Olympic Committee.  These are all inbound donations which would 
have already been subject to AML/CFT requirements through the banking and other systems, and 
therefore do not pose any TF risk.  
 
10.5 About 40% of NPOs either collect funds from or issue funds outside of the Territory. Of this 40%, 72% 
indicated that they send funds outside of the Territory.  The geographical location the funds are sent to 
varies significantly from NPO to NPO. However, the majority of the funds are being sent by religious 
organisations to their affiliates in the US.  There are also other affiliated bodies who send membership 
fees, and other funds to their sister organisations, some of which are in the US and some within the 
Caribbean region.  However, there are a small number of entities who occasionally send funds to 
jurisdictions that, while not listed as Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdictions, are located in geographical areas where 
the risk of terrorism is elevated.    
 
10.6 Based on international typologies reviewed, it is recognised that the NPO sector is vulnerable to being 
used for TF purposes through affiliation.  In the VI context, affiliation occurs primarily within the religious 
sub-sector.  The main religious organisations within the Territory generally have affiliations with other 
religious groups, predominantly in the USA.  As is established practice, these religious organisations send 
monies/dues back to the parent group/affiliate.   While NPOs may generally be vulnerable to being used 
for TF purposes through affiliation, based on type and location of receiving entities, there was no evidence 
to indicate that such affiliation is being used to foster TF via NPOs operating within the VI.  This is 
consistent with the sector, as it is highly unlikely that the sector would be used in this form for TF purposes.  
 
10.7 It is further recognised that the misuse of NPOs for TF purposes can occur through deception i.e. where 
terrorists or terrorist organisations create sham NPOs or portray themselves as being involved in some 
benevolent activity and solicit funds under the guise of such.  While this is a generally recognisable 
vulnerability for the NPO sector globally, there is no evidence of any such occurrence taking place by 
entities established in the VI.  There is also no evidence to indicate that local NPOs supporting charities 
abroad have unwittingly sent funds to sham NPOs with terrorist connections.   
 
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |38 of 46 
 
10.8 In relation to foreign terrorist activities the risk of TF is assessed as Medium-Low.  Given the findings 
within the NPO sector, the risk of TF with regard to domestic terrorist activities has been assessed as 
extremely Low. 
11. CASINOS AND OTHER EMERGING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
 
Casinos 
11.1 The Virgin Islands Gaming and Betting Control Act was passed on 18 June 2020 but has not yet been 
brought into force.  Gambling is, therefore, still not permitted in the Territory.  There is, however, a level 
of illegal gambling within the Territory, primarily associated with horse racing and underground 
cockfighting.  While these activities give rise to an elevated risk of ML as identified in the Territory’s 2020 
Sectoral ML report, there is no evidence to indicate that such activity is linked to the financing of any 
foreign terrorist activity.  The risk of TF in relation to foreign terrorist activity, therefore, considered to be 
Low.  Further, given the lack of any identifiable domestic terrorist activity the risk of TF in support of such 
domestic activity through the gaming sector, legal or otherwise, is also considered Low. 
 
11.2 While gambling may not pose a high risk in relation to TF within the current context of the VI, given the 
jurisdiction’s inherent vulnerabilities to ML as outlined in the 2020 Sectoral ML Risk Assessment Report, 
it is critical that the Government ensure the proper framework is put in place to allow for effective 
AML/CFT supervision of this sector prior to the Act being brought into force.  
Emerging Products and Technologies 
11.3 The use of emerging technologies, and more specifically Virtual Assets, has given rise internationally to 
concerns of abuse of these technologies by terrorists to fund their activities.  However, this appears more 
theoretical at this stage as there is limited data to indicate wide use of these products by terrorist 
organisations.  Nevertheless, recognition of the potential risk posed by VA and VASPs by international 
standards setters, particularly the FATF, which has now called for the regulation and supervision of these 
entities in like manner to other FIs, indicates that the potential risk posed by these products should be 
taken seriously and continuously monitored.   
 
11.4 The VI is in the process of drafting legislation that will bring VAs and VASPs wishing to conduct business in 
or from within the VI under regulatory supervision in accordance with FATF requirements.  The use of 
these products and technologies within the Territory is not currently permitted.  However, under existing 
financial services legislation, primarily SIBA, some VA and VASPs are required to be licensed and/or 
authorised. For example, a mutual fund that is set up to operate and hold virtual assets is required to be 
approved. A BVI legal person or legal arrangement that provides investment business services to these 
entities would also be required to be licensed under SIBA should specific criteria, as set out by the 
regulator, be met.  It is recognised, however, that normal BVIBCs that are not regulated, and which 
operate globally, do pose an inherent risk, as these entities may, and do, operate as VA exchanges and 
ICOs.  As such, the probability of these entities being misused for TF purposes is elevated.  However, there 
has been no evidence of any such misuse based on SARs filed and MLA and other international 
cooperation requests received.  
Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2020 | Version 1.0 |39 of 46 
 
 
11.5 The VI’s vulnerability exists primarily in that the majority of transactions are carried out on a non-face-to-
face basis which offers a higher degree of anonymity than traditional non-cash payment methods. Further, 
VASPs may also include transfers that are anonymous or pseudo-anonymous making it difficult to identify 
beneficiaries of the transactions, thereby elevating the risk above other existing FIs.   
 
11.6 In relation to the financing of foreign terrorist activities, given the potential exposure relative to the use 
of BVIBCs, the risk of TF in the regard is assessed as High. The risk of these emerging technologies being 
misused for the purpose of financing domestic terrorist activities, however, is considered Low.   
 
12. RECOMMENDATIONS   
 
12.1 Based on the findings of this assessment a number of recommendations have been identified.  For ease 
of reference these recommendations have been grouped into recommendations that should be 
addressed at the national level, those that are specific to the relevant supervisory authority and those

13. CONCLUSION   
 
13.1 While TF was considered during the initial NRA in 2016, the execution of this TF risk assessment exercise 
has provided a more in-depth review of the Territory’s exposure to TF and TF related matters.  The 
comprehensive nature of this report, which not only looked into the risks relative to the Territory’s FIs, 
but also those of its DNFBPs and NPOs, was intended to provide a clearer understanding of the current 
level of exposure to TF and TF related matters facing the Territory.   
 
13.2 On the domestic front, the threat of TF or terrorist related activities is considered very low.  The findings 
of the evaluation of the domestic labour market and trade activities, including the movement of funds 
supports this.  The risk of TF within each of the sectors reviewed for the purposes of facilitating domestic 
terrorist activities was also found to be quite low.  As noted in the report, the elevated level of risk 
identified within the various DNFBP sub-sectors is as a result of the lack of mitigating controls currently in 
place, more so than actual exposure to TF activities.   
 
13.3 Where the threat level becomes elevated is in relation to cross-border activities carried out by the BVIBCs 
registered in the VI that conduct business globally.  Such international exposure increases the possible 
facilitation, whether knowingly or unknowingly, of TF to route funds to terrorist organisations.  The risk 
of TF to facilitate foreign terrorist related activities, however, was found to be relatively low based on size 
and activities carried out within the sectors reviewed.  It is recognised that the size of the client base of 
the TCSP sector increases the risk of misuse of such vehicles for TF purposes, as does the high degree of 
anonymity available through the use of VAs and services provided by VASPs, both of which remain 
unregulated and not subject to AML/CFT requirements.   
 
13.4 The results of this exercise should be used by supervisors and supervised entities alike to better 
understand the TF risks within the jurisdiction and to ensure that the preventative or mitigating measures 
they have in place to counter TF remain appropriate and effective.   Additionally, the results of this 
assessment should be used by supervisory authorities to aid in shaping their inspection programmes and 
identifying those entities that may require more specialised supervision. 
 
13.5 399Although the results of this assessment indicate that there is very little evidence to support the Virgin 
Islands being a source of TF, authorities and supervised entities must remain vigilant.   The methods by 
which terrorist activities are being financed continue to evolve.  It is imperative, therefore, that the Virgin 
Islands continues to review its CFT regime on an ongoing basis and seek to ensure that it remains robust 
and adaptable to any developing risks.
