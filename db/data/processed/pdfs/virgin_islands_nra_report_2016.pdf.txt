Executive Summary 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
This is the British Virgin Islands’ first money laundering and terrorist financing 
national risk assessment (NRA). It aims to help the Virgin Islands understand the 
effectiveness of its measures and systems for anti-money laundering (AML) and 
combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) across Government, supervisory and 
law enforcement agencies and the regulated and private sectors.  
1.2 
The NRA had high-level political commitment, a focused approach and dedicated 
time and resources. It results from the Virgin Islands’ determination to meet 
international standards and respond to international expectations, including the 
Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Conducting a NRA 
is one of the accepted methods of satisfying a country’s obligations to understand, 
assess and mitigate its ML/TF risks. 
1.3 
The NRA reviewed the period 2011-2014 to identify threats and vulnerabilities for a 
range of agencies and sectors. Some of the challenges detected were addressed 
during or shortly after the NRA process and this is noted in relevant places of the 
Report where considered necessary. Plans are currently being developed to 
address other issues.  
1.4 
The aim is for all necessary steps to be taken to improve matters and mitigate risks 
by targeting resources where they are most needed. It would be helpful to conduct 
a further review within a year to assess progress in giving effect to the 
recommendations of the Report. 
1.5 
This NRA differs from ones undertaken by other countries in the detail of the analysis 
and areas for improvements published. In addition to identifying threats and 
vulnerabilities, the Report is a self-assessment of the BVI’s AML/CFT compliance 
level. This approach is considered helpful in assisting the territory to understand its 
shortcomings better and undertake appropriate remedial measures to mitigate the 
identified threats and vulnerabilities. 
2. 
NRA methodology 
2.1 
A broad section of the Government and Virgin Islands society participated in the 
NRA process. The Cabinet set the policy for compliance with FATF 
Recommendation One and established the structure for conducting the NRA. 
Overall policy was set by a committee (NRAC) chaired by the Premier. Its other 
members were the Governor, Deputy Governor, Attorney General, Managing 
Director/CEO of the Financial Services Commission, Financial Secretary and a 
 
ii 
 
private sector representative. The NRAC met every two months or more often as 
requested by the NRASG. 
2.2 
A Steering Group (NRASG), supported by a secretariat, was responsible for the 
conduct of the NRA, including developing the NRA framework. It trained, guided and 
evaluated Assessors and prepared this Report on the basis of the findings and 
reports of the Assessors. The NRASG was chaired by the FSC’s Director of Policy 
Research and Statistics and included members from the FIA, FSC, ODPP and 
RVIPF, some of whom are trained assessors in the Fourth Round of Mutual 
Evaluations and have participated in peer review assessments. 
2.3 
A Public Education Committee (PEC) raised public awareness of the NRA and the 
ramifications of ML/TF activities through a series of public outreach programmes. 
A Communications Committee encouraged public and private sector participation 
through media engagement. 
2.4 
Members of the Inter-governmental Committee on AML/CFT Matters (IGC) 
nominated 39 Assessors to undertake the NRA. These assessed competent 
authorities, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, designated non-
financial businesses and professions, non-profit organisations and high value goods 
dealers. An Internal Reviewer and External Assessor reviewed the framework and 
this Report. The Internal Reviewer represented the Territory’s Joint Anti-money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Advisory Committee (JALTFAC). 
2.5 
Following initial data collection through pre-assessment questionnaires, the NRA’s 
scope was expanded to include key governmental and non-governmental 
institutions as these might have vulnerabilities that might prevent implementation of 
the sectoral recommendations. The NRA exercise thus went beyond the usual pure 
risk assessment by considering all areas relevant to ensuring full compliance with 
AML/CFT obligations.  
2.6 
Where any deficiencies were identified, this was not intended as an indictment but 
as an opportunity for improvement to ensure the strongest possible AML/CFT 
defence. 
2.7 
In Phase I, relevant persons were invited to respond to pre-assessment 
questionnaires (PAQs). A total of 485 PAQs were distributed and 193 responses 
were received, representing a 39.8 per cent response rate.   
2.8 
The PAQs explored international cooperation issues relevant to CAs; regulation and 
supervision by the FSC and FIA; internal controls; operational risk factors; record 
keeping requirements; AML/CFT compliance and handling of STRs by FIs, NPOs, 
DNFBPs and HVGs; how FIs and DNFBPs cooperate internationally; law 
enforcement and how the FIA functions as an FIU; and national, intra-agency 
AML/CFT cooperation and coordination 
2.9 
In Phase II, Assessors conducted 237 onsite interviews. As well as specific 
questions, these used the responses in Phase I to gather missing data, verify key 
 
iii 
 
information and compare what entities said with what they had written. Assessors 
also used data from other sources such as the IMF, Global Forum, FATF and 
CFATF.  
2.10 Both quantitative and qualitative data were used to make the requisite AML/CFT 
(including proliferation financing [PF]) assessment, given that criminals use the 
same or similar ways to raise or move funds. The analysis took account of 
frameworks such as the NRA Framework (NRAF) and relevant literature issued by 
the World Bank.  
2.11 Risk assessment criteria included whether reporting entities, CAs and LEAs had 
robust controls to identify and mitigate ML/TF risk; whether measures were 
commensurate with the risks identified; the types of Virgin Islands criminal activity 
that were ML/TF predicate offences; and the extent of cooperation to mitigate ML/TF 
risks. 
2.12 Factors included assessment of LEAs, the relevant regulators and CAs; and the 
Territory’s international cooperation mechanisms. Private sector input was used in 
assessing FIs, DNFBPs, HVGs and NPOs. 
2.13 Questions were risk weighted based on the FATF Recommendations and the 
probability and frequency of an occurrence and its ML/TF and international 
cooperation impact on the Virgin Islands. A weighted risk average was arrived at 
and ratings of high, medium or low applied. 
3. 
Domestic advisory bodies 
3.1 
The Joint Anti-money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Advisory 
Committee (JALTFAC) advises the FSC on AML/CFT initiatives. It performs to a 
generally high standard and its meetings are in-depth and robust. Work is ongoing 
to increase public outreach and attendance at meetings. 
3.2 
The Inter-governmental Committee on AML/CFT Matters (IGC) raises public 
awareness of ML/TF issues and fosters AML/CFT cooperation between key 
domestic agencies and with overseas AML/CFT agencies. Attendance at IGC 
meetings and the provision of statistical data to the IGC has steadily improved since 
2011. An important area for improvement is for the IGC to undertake meaningful 
analysis of data to identify AML/CFT trends and typologies. 
3.3 
It is unclear what impact the IGC has had on improving the AML/CFT framework or 
awareness of ML/TF risks. A limitation is that the JALTFAC and IGC are not 
responsible for coordinating the AML/CFT regime in line with FATF 
Recommendations One and Two. It would be helpful to establish a national body 
that directs and coordinates all AML/CFT issues at the domestic level. 
 
iv 
 
4. 
Legal persons and arrangements 
4.1 
The Virgin Islands is not alone among international finance centres in being 
susceptible to the abuse of its corporate structures by unscrupulous persons. 
Through effective supervision, it seeks to ensure that lawful vehicles are not abused 
for ML, TF and other crime. 
4.2 
The Financial Services Commission (FSC) regulates and supervises the Virgin 
Islands’ financial services sector. This covers banking, insurance, mutual funds, 
investment business, trust and corporate service providers (TCSPs), financing and 
money service providers and insolvency practitioners. The FSC also approves 
authorised custodians and representatives, directors, senior officers and other 
independent officers. 
4.3 
Companies are governed by the BVI Business Companies Act (BVIBCA) and only 
a registered agent (RA) can apply to incorporate a company. Ownership and control 
may be vested in natural or legal persons. A BVIBC must have a registered office 
and agent in the Virgin Islands and maintain a register of members. Where records 
are maintained outside the BVI, the RA must know the address and who has control.  
4.4 
The FSC carries out AML/CFT oversight by regulating and supervising TCSPs who 
act as registered agents (RAs) to the level of a financial institution, in line with FATF 
Recommendations. TCSPs must risk-assess the BVIBCs for which they act. The 
FSC checks they are doing so through periodic inspections. This enables some 
identification of ML/TF risks. 
4.5 
A company can issue bearer shares, which must be immobilized and deposited with 
authorized or recognized custodians in or outside the BVI, along with ownership 
identification. Since July 2012, RAs within the Virgin Islands have had to maintain 
full information on the owners of bearer shares. Relatively few companies are 
authorised to issue bearer shares and CAs and LEAs such as the FSC, FIA and ITA 
are satisfied any risk has been contained. They have found getting information on 
people behind bearer shares straightforward.  
4.6 
The FSC carries out onsite inspections of authorised custodians but not of 
recognised custodians as they are investment exchanges or clearing organisations 
in an FATF member jurisdiction, where they are normally supervised to high 
standards. 
4.7 
Trust service business is regulated and subject to AML/CFT legislative provisions, 
with due diligence required. Trusts do not have to be registered, making it harder to 
quantify the number or the value of their assets. Limited partnerships may be formed 
under the Partnership Act, 1996 and must maintain a registered office and RA in the 
Virgin Islands which holds the name, address, amounts and contribution dates for 
each partner.  
 
v 
 
4.8 
For non-regulated entities, the FSC assesses risk by regulating and supervising 
their RAs, who must undertake CDD and other AML/CFT checks and understand 
their company’s business activities.  
5. 
Competent authorities (CAs) 
Governor’s Office (GO) 
5.1 
The Governor is Her Majesty’s representative in the Virgin Islands and in that 
capacity also serves her Majesty’s interests. He is responsible for security and 
governance, including extradition, and is the competent authority for the receipt and 
processing of incoming and outgoing MLA requests (excluding MLA requests 
related to the USA unless for extradition).  
5.2 
Both the GO and the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) act on MLA and 
extradition matters. The AGC is a member of the IGC and JALTFAC. It is the central 
authority for US MLA, while the GO is the central authority for MLA to and from other 
countries. There is lso opportunity to improve how the GO is made aware of requests 
sent directly to the AGC, to provide training for staff in MLA and extradition matters 
and to develop more detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for processing 
requests. 
5.3 
The GO has a records management policy and all files are secure. Maintaining 
information electronically would make it easier to locate files quickly and track any 
access granted. 
Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) 
5.4 
The Attorney General (AG) is the Government’s principal legal adviser and sits ex 
officio in Cabinet and in the House of Assembly. The AG’s independence is assured 
under The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007.  
5.5 
Medium-risk areas for improvement relate to governance and administration, 
handling of incoming MLA and international cooperation requests from foreign CAs, 
handling of outgoing MLA and international cooperation requests, the number of 
requests that are declined, complaints handling, records management and 
maintenance, and processing MLA requests and extradition in a timely manner 
5.6 
Swifter processing of extradition and MLA requests could be achieved by having an 
internal policy and written procedures for handling MLA requests, providing in-depth 
training for key staff and filling vacant posts. Opportunities for the AGC to be more 
proactive include asking foreign CAs for feedback on the information it has sent, 
entering into MoUs with overseas CAs, requesting clarification of unclear requests, 
and recommending reforms to Virgin Islands laws. 
5.7 
Other opportunities for improvement lie in extending training to all legal staff and 
addressing some security shortcomings. 
 
vi 
 
Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) 
5.8 
The Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) is a statutory body which functions 
autonomously and independently of Government. It is a fully participating member 
of the Egmont Group of financial intelligence units (FIUs) and the CFATF Working 
Group on FIUs. 
5.9 
Staff receive extensive, expert training. They understand their legal obligations on 
conflicts of interest and corruption despite no apparent formal training in these or 
PF. Records management and security are largely good. 
5.10 The Director effectively carries out the work of the FIA’s Steering Committee, 
although the committee is statutorily mandated to receive and review SARs/STRs. 
Increasing the number of skilled staff would help with speeding up SAR/STR 
investigations and prosecutions, responding to the large volume of overseas 
requests and reviewing compliance manuals. In the review period, SARs/STRs 
could not always be investigated in the year they were received, resulting in 
inordinate delays.  
5.11 The FIA has not proactively used the MoUs it has signed with numerous IGC 
members, as well as the IGC MMoU. Opportunity exists for greater cooperation 
between the FIA, RVIPF and ODPP, from identification to prosecution of possible 
ML offences. Obtaining feedback from overseas CAs after giving them information 
would help the FIA judge its effectiveness. 
5.12 The FIA’s SOP manual does not always reflect current practice and dates from 
November 2012. The FIA would benefit from having a documented procedure for 
document control and management, with regular review and revision. 
Financial Services Commission (FSC) 
5.13 The FSC has powers to regulate and supervise financial services businesses which 
are licensed, authorised or approved to carry out business in and from within the 
BVI. The FSC scored well on governance and administration, handling local CAs’ 
requests for assistance, providing feedback on declined requests, handling 
complaints and records management and maintenance. 
5.14 Areas of medium risk for improvement include the handling of incoming and 
outgoing MLA requests, challenges to MLA requests from foreign CAs and handling 
of complaints received.  
5.15 Of particular benefit would be increasing the number of staff dedicated to 
compliance inspection (there was a low level of inspections in the review period and 
slow finalising of reports) and to enforcement.  
5.16 The FSC’s risk assessment mechanisms are set out in various manuals, forms and 
guidance. Having a single document could help ensure that all those involved in risk 
assessment applied the same required criteria to the extent feasible. 
 
vii 
 
International Tax Authority (ITA) 
5.17 The ITA executes bilateral and multilateral tax agreements. It is a department of 
Government, and the Financial Secretary delegates to the ITA his functions as CA 
for all exchange of information related to tax matters.  
5.18 The highest risk area for improvement is the timely processing of requests for MLA. 
Other areas include inter-agency cooperation, handling incoming MLA requests 
from foreign CAs, assistance provided in MLA requests that result in prosecution 
and conviction, and handling of external complaints.  
5.19 The ITA is responsible for serving notices to people to provide information. Ending 
its reliance on the Ministry of Finance’s messenger for this would speed up the 
serving of notices and enhance international cooperation. 
5.20 Where service providers fail to provide information, the ITA can refer matters to the 
ODPP for prosecution. However, it has no power to impose administrative penalties 
itself. Improving the ODPP’s responsiveness would enhance international 
cooperation. 
5.21 The ITA’s governance and administration structure and system are largely good, as 
are handling of outgoing MLA requests, provision of feedback on declined requests, 
handling of complaints filed by the ITA and records management and maintenance. 
6. 
Financial institutions (FIs) 
6.1 
The Virgin Islands’ financial services industry is comprised of traditionally regulated 
FIs, which include banking business, insurance business, investment business, 
TCSPs, insolvency practitioners and the financing and money services business. 
The largest sub-sector is TCSPs, which, through company incorporations, are the 
main direct revenue generator for the Government. The second largest is 
investment business, which by its nature exists largely outside of the Territory.  
6.2 
Common areas for improvement include corporate governance issues, beneficial 
ownership, client verification/CDD and ECDD measures, AML/CFT internal control 
measures, internal risk assessment measures, filing of SARs/STRs, banking 
relationships and electronic transfers, high-risk business practices, demographics 
as it relates to customer, beneficial owner, and counterparty transactions, and client-
based risk assessment measures. 
6.3 
Most FIs have sufficient and effective AML/CFT internal controls in place, with the 
possible exception of MSBs. The banking and TCSP sub-sectors make the highest 
level of SARs/STRs filings. MSBs and banking institutions have room for 
improvement in mitigating geographical risks. 
6.4 
Looking at risk frameworks and client verification and CDD/ECDD measures, 
TCSPs and banking institutions present a lower risk than insolvency practitioners 
and insurance. 
 
viii 
 
Trust and corporate service providers (TCSPs) 
6.5 
Although under the FATF Recommendations TCSPs are considered DNFBPs, the 
Virgin Islands regulates them under the Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990, the 
Company Management Act, 1990 and related legislation. Many TCSPs are a part of 
groups in other international finance centres (IFCs) and most clients are non-
resident in the BVI. 
6.6 
High-risk areas for improvement are TCSPs’ over-reliance on third parties to obtain 
relevant client information and ensuring accessibility of records. As regards client 
verification, BO and CDD/ECDD, TCSPs could be more effective in applying risk 
assessments and more proactive in filing SARs/STRs. It would be helpful to improve 
the keeping of records and allow for their easy access and retrieval.  
6.7 
In 2011-14, TCSPs accounted for 30 per cent of all FSC inspections. Enforcement 
action appears largely to rely on onsite inspections. This suggests an opportunity 
for the FSC to go beyond onsite inspections to ensure TCSPs follow legal 
obligations at all times. 
Insurance business 
6.8 
Insurance business is licensable under the Insurance Act, 2008 and the Insurance 
Regulations, 2009 (IR) and includes domestic insurers, captive insurers, insurance 
managers, loss adjusters and insurance intermediaries (agents and brokers). 
Domestic insurance accounts for most business, and property and casualty 
insurance in particular pose a low AML/CFT risk. Foreign insurance is undertaken 
primarily by captive insurers, also low risk. 
6.9 
Domestic businesses maintain readily available BO information in the Territory. 
Two-thirds of business conducted elsewhere do the same or make the information 
easily accessible, which means there is an opportunity for the other third to do so. 
All maintain CDD/ECDD and client information in the BVI. All have written policies 
for accepting customers, which are mostly adequate.  
6.10 Four in five do not maintain records of one-off transactions but the risk level is 
medium, as it is or the location of customers, BOs and counter-party transactions. 
Opportunities for improvement include procedures for identifying different customer 
risk categories (undertaken by 60 per cent of insurers) and risk-profiling of business 
relationships (40 per cent) and filing of SARs/STRs (27 per cent).  
6.11 There are no high-risk banking relationships or relationships with FIs in high-risk 
jurisdictions.  
Insolvency business 
6.12 Insolvency practitioners are licensed under the Insolvency Act, 2003 and are 
required to maintain AML/CT systems and controls. The Report’s sample size of five 
practitioners is too small to draw objective conclusions but risks are considered low 
 
ix 
 
given the nature of insolvency work and that practitioners are normally appointed by 
the High Court and effectively function as officers of the Court.  
6.13 Most have access to BO information in the Virgin Islands on their business 
relationships and all have CDD/ECDD measures in place and adequate written 
policies for accepting customers, with good understanding of client relationships. All 
carry out risk assessments of their business and business relationships and 
maintain readily accessible records.  
6.14 Based on the low filing of SARs/STRs, practitioners may need to review their 
AML/CFT reporting mechanisms. Greater inspection by the FSC might enable more 
timely discovery of any ML/TF risks. 
Investment business 
6.15 Investment business in the Virgin Islands is regulated by the FSC under SIBA. This 
covers all types of mutual funds. Investment advisers, investment managers, 
broker/dealers and fund administrators are also licensed.  
6.16 Most service providers are outside the Virgin Islands and are not covered by the 
NRA. While it would be helpful to asses these, a review of those in the Territory 
provides some useful learning. All licensees wherever located must have a local 
authorised representative.  
6.17 High-risk areas for improvement are beneficial ownership and CDD, and client 
verification and CDD/ECDD measures. Medium-risk areas include staff training, 
internal risk assessment measures, SAR/STR filing, records maintenance and 
accessibility, banking relationships and electronic payments, involvement in high-
risk business practices, client-based risk assessment measures and demographics 
in relation to customers, BOs of customers and counterparty transactions.  
6.18 In the review period, the FSC carried out 25 onsite inspections. This suggests an 
opportunity to enhance supervisory resources to increase inspections and 
undertake an in-depth analysis of ML/TF and supervisory risks. 
Banking institutions 
6.19 The banking sector is regulated under the BTCA and other related regulatory 
legislation and each bank operating in the Territory is licensed. The Virgin Islands 
has just six commercial banks and one restricted banking institution. Nearly all their 
business is domestic. 
6.20 Banks have among the most effective AML/CFT controls of all Virgin Islands sub-
sectors. BO information is well managed and maintained, with information kept in 
the Virgin Islands or readily available, and staff receive AML/CFT training and can 
report risk concerns. All requirements of FATF Recommendation 16 on electronic 
transfers are met. In the review period, banks accounted for 30 per cent of all 
SARs/STRs filed, demonstrating their vigilance. 
 
x 
 
6.21 There is some opportunity for improvement in corporate governance, managing 
banking relationships, verifying domestic business and client demographics. 
Money services businesses (MSBs) 
6.22 Money services businesses (MSBs) have been regulated since the enactment of 
the Financing and Money Services Act, 2009. The first MSB licence was issued in 
2011, followed by another in 2012, and the two MSBs remain for the periods 2013 
and 2014. With the global trend towards de-risking, access to the banking system 
for MSBs in the BVI and the region is extremely limited. This potentially poses a 
serious risk of driving money transmission underground, where there is no 
supervisory or monitoring mechanism. 
6.23 High-risk areas for improvement are collecting and maintaining BO and CDD 
information, internal risk assessment measures, SAR/STR filing and client-based 
risk assessment measures. Other areas include corporate governance, client 
verification and CDD/ECDD measures, AML/CFT internal controls, banking 
relationships, high-risk business practices and demographics in relation to 
customers, BO and counterparty transactions.  
6.24 Record keeping is good. Most MSB users do not send large amounts but are largely 
meeting home country obligations. However, having procedures in place for the 
electronic transfer of funds would be useful. 
6.25 The FSC conducted only one inspection of an MSB during the period under review 
and has not issued AML/CFT guidelines to assist MSBs. Regulation has yet to 
address the aggregate size of remittances, type of clientele and the purpose of 
remittances. 
7. 
Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions 
(DNFBPs) 
7.1 
The DNFBP sector in the Virgin Islands is small, considering that the TCSP sector 
is treated as part of the FI sector. DNFBPs dealing in precious metals and stone are 
addressed separately in the HVG section of this Report. There is some uncertainty 
about numbers as many businesses that engage in DNFBP-type activities have 
trade licences but are not currently required to register with the FIA.  
7.2 
The DNFBPs assessed are legal practitioners (including notaries public), real estate 
agents (REAs) and accountants. Medium-risk areas for improvement are corporate 
governance and administration, resources for monitoring AML/CFT compliance, 
internal risk assessment measures, staff training and filing of SARs/STRs. 
7.3 
There is opportunity to deepen FIA oversight, which consisted mostly of desk 
reviews rather than onsite inspections in the review period. The FIA inspected 
neither REAs or law firms in the review period, which provokes further reflection 
about its supervision of the sector. 
 
xi 
 
7.4 
The real estate agents were least aware of their AML/CFT obligations but there is 
no evidence of ML/TF activity among REAs or any attempt at this. Areas for 
improvement include governance and administration, CDD/ECDD measures, 
internal control measures, resources for monitoring ML/TF risk, risk policies, staff 
training and reporting of SARs/STRs. They regularly accepted cash for property 
transactions, whereas 95 per cent of accountants and law firms did not accept cash 
at all.  
7.5 
The legal practitioners demonstrated better familiarity with the AML/CFT laws and 
had appropriate CDD/ECDD and client verification measures in place. A large 
number are linked to regulated entities such as a Virgin Islands trust company or an 
international law firm, and understand their AML/CFT obligations. Medium-risk 
areas for improvement are corporate governance and internal risk assessment 
deficiencies.  
7.6 
Most legal firms have at least one practitioner appointed as a notary public and 
nearly all Virgin Islands notaries public are legal practitioners. These present a low 
AML/CFT risk as their reliance on original documents establishes a paper trail and 
requests for their services come from regulated entities, mostly TCSPs.  
7.7 
As regards accountants, most did not engage in activities within the scope of the 
AMLR but largely undertook auditing and insolvency. Although they filed only one 
SAR/STR in the review period, accountants pose a low AML/CFT risk as they know 
their obligations and have client risk-profiling and monitoring in place. 
8. 
Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) 
8.1 
NPOs reviewed for the NRA comprised community-based organisations, 
foundations, national country associations, performing arts organisations, religious 
organisations, service organisations, sports organisations and youth organisations. 
8.2 
Although NPOs generally lack understanding of ML/TF, they do not pose a material 
ML/TF risk to the BVI. Most are small, community-based, know their donors locally 
and have a low income. Few NPOs appoint MLROs, provide AML/CFT training or 
carry out background checks on potential members or volunteers. None filed 
SARs/STRs in the review period. Those with international affiliations generally rely 
on the systems of HQs in jurisdictions recognised under the AMLTFCOP.  
8.3 
No NPO appears to engage in high-risk activities or large monetary transactions 
regularly. The bulk of their activities is within the Virgin Islands and can be 
monitored.  
8.4 
Following the NRA assessment, the Assessors consider that sections 4 and 5 of the 
AMLTFCOP should be reviewed to reduce the compliance burden on smaller NPOs 
as they generally do not signal vulnerability to ML/TF. Supervision by the FIA for 
AML/CFT compliance should still continue on a risk basis. The NPOA should also 
 
xii 
 
be reviewed to reduce the burdens that have prevented most NPOs from being able 
to register with the NPO Board. 
9. 
High value goods (HVG) dealers 
9.1 
HVG dealers are persons who buy and sell certain high value goods for a cash 
payment of $15,000 or more in any currency. While reviewed separately by the NRA, 
they are supervised by the FIA as a sub-set of DNFBPs. There are four designated 
categories: boat (yacht) dealers; vehicle dealers; jewellers; and furniture, machinery 
and art dealers.  
9.2 
Compliance with AML/CFT obligations varied across the categories. Areas for 
improvement include training in detecting red flags for ML/TF and the obligation to 
file SARs/STRs. Other areas include ensuring client verification systems, 
conducting CDD/ECDD on business relationships, internal control measures, having 
sufficient resources to monitor staff’s AML/CFT compliance and conducting risk 
assessments.  
9.3 
Despite this, the HVG sector is considered to pose only a medium risk. The industry 
is small and most transactions are carried out using credit/debit cards, high-value 
transactions are conducted by FIs and most dealers have adequate record-keeping 
measures. 
9.4 
None was inspected for AML/CFT compliance during the period under review, 
although following the NRA, the FIA has inspected seven entities and is raising 
HVGs’ awareness of their obligations. 
10. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) 
10.1 The NRA reviewed seven law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with an AML/CFT 
locus: the Department of Immigration, Her Majesty’s Customs, the Royal Virgin 
Islands Police Force (and its Financial Crimes Unit), the Office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions, the BVI Airports Authority, the BVI Ports Authority, and the 
judiciary (Magistrate’s Court and High Court).  
10.2 Overall, high-risk areas for improvement are handling incoming MLA and extradition 
requests, handling outgoing MLA requests, processing MLA requests, ability to 
monitor BVIBCs for ML/TF, and handling of investigations relating to ML/TF. Other 
areas are of governance and administration, staff training in AML/CFT, records 
management and maintenance, handling of seizure of contraband, smuggling and 
security breaches, and inter-agency cooperation.  
Immigration Department (ID) 
10.3 The ID is responsible for controlling entry into the Virgin Islands and approving 
residence of people within the BVI. It is governed by the Immigration and Passport 
 
xiii 
 
Ordinance and headed by the Chief Immigration Officer (CIO), who reports directly 
to the Permanent Secretary in the Premier’s Office.  
10.4 The ID overall appears to pose a low risk, although a lack of data left questions 
open. A high-risk area for improvement is training in AML/CFT matters, with other 
areas being governance and administration, records maintenance and accessibility, 
and smuggling activities and deportation of illegal migrants and undesirable 
persons. 
Her Majesty’s Customs (HMC) 
10.5 Her Majesty’s Customs (HMC) prevents restricted and prohibited goods from 
entering or leaving the Virgin Islands and assists with border protection in 
cooperation with the ID and RVIPF. It comes under the Ministry of Finance and the 
Commissioner of Customs reports directly to the Financial Secretary. 
10.6 HMC poses a low risk overall, with good governance and administration, inter-
agency cooperation and an accessible records management system. Staff training 
(including around bribery and corruption), the handling of seizures and smuggling, 
and vulnerability to security breaches would benefit from greater focus. 
10.7 HMC does not set a timeframe for responding to international information requests 
but claims to do so efficiently and there were no outstanding requests at the time of 
the NRA. It would be helpful to develop records to verify numbers of requests and 
the adequacy of staffing for handling these. 
Royal Virgin Islands Police Force (RVIPF) 
10.8 The RVIPF is governed by the Police Act. Its duties include maintaining law and 
order and preventing and detecting crime. It arrests suspects, prefers or initiates 
charges and forwards matters for prosecution to the ODPP.  
10.9 The RVIPF has the most high-risk areas for improvement of the LEAs. These 
comprise staff training in AML/CFT matters, handling of outgoing MLA requests and 
of incoming MLA and extradition requests from foreign CAs, records maintenance 
and accessibility, feedback on declined requests and monitoring BVIBCs for ML/TF 
activities. Other areas are governance and administration, inter-agency cooperation 
on incoming MLA requests and handling of investigations relating to ML/TF. 
10.10 Staffing is a high-priority area for improvement. Human and technical resources for 
the Crime Division, FCU and CID (including communication and storage) need to be 
commensurate with the level of criminal activity, given these units’ AML/CFT 
importance. The RVIPF training budget was radically reduced in 2014. 
10.11 The Police Service Commission advises the Governor on appointing, removing and 
disciplining RVIPF officers. The National Security Council (NSC) advises him on 
national security and has to approve any officer appointment above Chief Inspector 
rank. A lack of responsiveness from both institutions meant their overall 
effectiveness could not be evaluated. 
 
xiv 
 
10.12 With regard to internal cooperation between the RVIPF’s own agencies, greater 
appreciation of the FCU’s role would enhance ML investigations. There is an 
opportunity for the CID to consult the FCU as a matter of course and develop a 
common procedure.  
10.13 As the agency responsible for investigating all crimes in the Territory, the RVIPF is 
required to liaise with all CAs, other LEAs and other agencies. There is room for 
improvement here: the MoU with the FIA for processing Interpol requests could 
operate more effectively; HMC was not clear about the outcome of matters it had 
sent to the RVIPF for investigation; and guidance for officers on investigations and 
an expansion of expertise and resources would reduce delays between the RVIPF 
recording offences and submitting them to the ODPP. Tackling the disparities 
between the offences which the RVIPF and ODPP record would help match charges 
brought to offences prosecuted.  
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) 
10.14 The ODPP is an independent team of prosecutors headed by the DPP, who is 
responsible for all its proceedings. The DPP initiates and may discontinue 
prosecutions. 
10.15 The ODPP does not have any high-risk areas for improvement. Two other areas 
relate to governance and administration and to inter-agency cooperation. The latter 
particularly refers to the RVIPF, in order to ensure that all the ML/TF that could arise 
from predicate offences is considered. There could be greater willingness to pursue 
and prosecute ML-related offences. 
10.16 The ODPP is responsible for pursuing confiscation and forfeiture of property 
connected to offences prosecuted. The impetus to pursue confiscation as part of 
prosecutions appears limited, as no evidence was shown to demonstrate otherwise. 
Indeed, LEAs generally appear satisfied to pursue forfeiture proceedings rather than 
conduct investigations with a view to confiscation. Fuller training on asset recovery, 
asset restraint, confiscation and forfeiture might improve this.  
BVI Airports Authority (BVIAA) 
10.17 The BVIAA has responsibility for the administration of all the Virgin Islands’ airports, 
including ensuring their security.  
10.18 The BVIAA does not have any high-risk areas for improvement. There are, however, 
areas of medium risk that relate to governance and administration, inter-agency 
cooperation and level of interaction with other LEAs, staff training, records 
maintenance and accessibility, and seizures, smuggling and security breaches. 
BVI Ports Authority (BVIPA) 
10.19 The BVIPA is responsible for the Virgin Islands’ seven ports: five domestic and 
international terminals, one cruise port and one cargo facility. 
 
xv 
 
10.20 Two high-risk areas for improvement are staff training (there is an opportunity to 
introduce AML/CFT training as it relates to smuggling) and the handling of seizures, 
smuggling and security breaches. Other areas related to governance and 
administration, inter-agency cooperation and interaction with other LEAs, and 
records maintenance and accessibility.   
The judiciary: Magistrate’s Court (MC) 
10.21 The MC decides mainly summary criminal matters, minor civil claims and certain 
family law matters. It also has limited jurisdiction over maritime salvage and wrecks. 
It does a good job of safeguarding its independence. Its decisions are appealable to 
the Court of Appeal. 
10.22 A high-risk area for improvement is staff training, in that although matters may have 
AML/CFT dimensions, only the Senior Magistrate has received AML/CFT training. 
It would also be helpful to address resource issues, as the absence of court 
reporters means justice is dispensed less speedily, most staff work extra time every 
day, and the JEMS case tracking system cannot be used optimally. 
10.23 Other areas for improvement are governance and administration, level of records 
maintenance and accessibility, handling of complaints and level of inter-agency 
cooperation. Better physical security for court premises should be considered. 
The judiciary: High Court (HC) 
10.24 The HC has three judges, one dedicated to the ECSC’s Commercial Division based 
in the Virgin Islands and two dealing mostly with criminal and civil matters. HC 
decisions are appealable to and heard by the Court of Appeal and the latter’s 
decision can be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  
10.25 The HC’s written cooperation with the NRA extended only to responding to 
questions about staffing. While a full evaluation is not possible, an interview with HC 
Registry officials has nonetheless enabled some analysis. A separate review of the 
HC Registry would be helpful. 
10.26 Medium-risk areas for improvement are governance and administration, staff 
training and records management and accessibility. The HC Registry would benefit 
from better appreciating its relevance to the Virgin Islands’ AML/CFT regime.  
11. Freezing, seizure, confiscation and forfeiture 
11.1 The Virgin Islands’ legislative framework to freeze, seize, confiscate and forfeit 
assets and proceeds of criminal conduct for the purpose of mitigating ML/TF risks 
includes the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1992 (DTOA), Criminal Justice 
(International Cooperation) Act, 1993 (CJ(IC)A), Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 
1997 (PCCA), Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act (Cap. 178) (DPMA) and Anti-
 
xvi 
 
terrorism (Financing and Other Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2002 
(AT(FOM)(OT)O.  
11.2 The LEAs were assessed to determine whether they facilitate effective freezing, 
seizure, confiscation and forfeiture (foreign agencies can identify Virgin Islands 
counterparts, procedures allow informal and spontaneous sharing of information, 
asset sharing agreements are in place to facilitate asset tracing and financial 
investigations) and minimise structural impediments (sufficient expertise and trained 
personnel, mechanisms and procedures for real-time joint enforcement and 
prosecution, especially in cross border requests, streamlining asset tracing and 
financial investigation and reduce bureaucratic barriers around formal requests) 
11.3 The RVIPF can investigate predicate offences, including ML, and apply to the courts 
for an order to freeze, seize, forfeit or confiscate cash, property or other assets 
suspected or linked to proceeds of crime. The Financial Crime Unit (FCU) in the 
RVIPF takes responsibility for cash seized by HMC and has a seizure policy which 
covers cash of at least $10,000. An area for improvement is how to identify and 
record cash for investigative purposes. Data from the overall RVIPF and its FCU 
(which undertakes more detailed recording) show differences for various types of 
forfeiture and seizure. 
11.4 HMC may seize and detain goods, including vessels, and condemn contraband. A 
declaration system requires disclosure when moving $10,000 or more in or out of 
the BVI. Penalties range from cash forfeiture to fines and imprisonment. In the 
review period, HMC recorded no outgoing declarations or related cash seizures. 
Better training, including in identifying signs and detection of suspicious persons, 
could improve detection. It is also not clear that HMC data for other crimes reflects 
the scale of the problem. Addressing inconsistencies in ODPP and RVIPF data 
would clarify whether seizures led to investigation and prosecution. 
11.5 The ODPP is responsible for initiating or undertaking confiscation proceedings for 
cash forfeiture. There was no evidence of an active pursuit of confiscations during 
the review period, perhaps due to a focus by investigators and prosecutors on 
conviction than confiscation. Areas for improvement include procedures for 
confiscating the proceeds of crime, coordination between the RVIPF and the ODPP, 
ODPP guidance for police investigators on identifying ML, and training for 
investigators and prosecutors. 
11.6 When it suspects they may be the proceeds of crime, the FIA has the power to 
freeze funds for two periods of 72 hours. It did not take any temporary freezing action 
during the review period. 
11.7 The AGC provides legal advice on MLA requests, including on matters relating to 
the confiscation of property, and has developed SOPs for these. Maintaining 
consistent records would help provide a true picture of processed MLA requests, 
especially in relation to seizures, freezing, confiscation and forfeiture orders. 
 
xvii 
 
12. Terrorist financing and proliferation financing 
12.1 Although low, there is some risk of TF through LEAs, CAs, FIs, NPOs and DNFBPs. 
Areas for improvement include training LEAs and CAs to detect, investigate and 
prosecute TF, and ensure proper verification of all persons engaging in business 
activities within the financial services sector. There were no TF investigations, 
prosecutions or convictions in the Territory in the review period. 
12.2 The Virgin Islands has criminalised TF and implements UNSCR 1267, 1373, 1988 
and 1989. It has not criminalised the restrictions and prohibitions outlined in UNSCR 
2178 in relation to foreign terrorist fighters.  
12.3 As with TF, the risk of PF in the Virgin Islands is considered to be low and relatively 
remote. However, due to the nature of the financial services industry, it is recognised 
that some risk may exist of the misuse of corporate entities to fund WMDs. The 
enactment of the Proliferation Financing (Prohibition) Act, 2009 (PF(P)A) is a 
positive step. 
 
 
1 
 
1.  Introduction 
1.1 
This is the British Virgin Islands’ first money laundering and terrorist financing 
national risk assessment (NRA). It aims to help the Virgin Islands understand the 
effectiveness of its measures and systems for anti-money laundering (AML) and 
combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) across Government, supervisory and 
law enforcement agencies and the regulated and private sectors.  
1.2 
The NRA had high-level political commitment, a focused approach and dedicated 
time and resources. It results from the Virgin Islands’ determination to meet 
international standards and respond to international expectations, including the 
Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Conducting a NRA 
is one of the accepted methods of satisfying a country’s obligations to understand, 
assess and mitigate its ML/TF risks. 
1.3 
The NRA reviewed the period 2011-2014 to identify threats and vulnerabilities for a 
range of agencies and sectors. Some of the challenges detected were addressed 
during or shortly after the NRA process and this is noted in places. Plans are 
currently being developed to address other issues.  
1.4 
The aim is for all necessary steps to be taken to improve matters and mitigate risks 
by targeting resources where they are most needed. It would be helpful to conduct 
a further review within a year to assess progress in giving effect to the 
recommendations of the Report. 
1.5 
This NRA differs from ones undertaken by other countries in the detail of the analysis 
and areas for improvements published. In addition to identifying threats and 
vulnerabilities, the Report is a self-assessment of the BVI’s AML/CFT compliance 
level. This approach is considered helpful in assisting the territory to understand its 
shortcomings better and undertake appropriate remedial measures to mitigate the 
identified threats and vulnerabilities.

2. Overview of the BVI economy 
2.1 
The British Virgin Islands (“BVI” or “Virgin Islands”) is a United Kingdom Overseas 
Territory. It uses the US dollar as its official currency, has a low crime rate and is 
politically stable, with a cabinet-style government. Located in the Lesser Antilles in 
the Caribbean, it consists of some 60 islands, islets and cays, 20 of which are 
inhabited. It has a population of 28,800, of which 60 per cent are expatriates from 
over 110 countries and territories. 
2.2 
Until the introduction of financial services in the late 1970s, the Virgin Islands was 
relatively poor and dependent on small industries, the largest being tourism. By 
2013, GDP had grown to $891.03 million, with tourism and financial services 
together contributing 53 per cent of the Territory’s GDP. 
2.3 
The US is the Virgin Islands’ main source of goods and the Territory mirrors the US’s 
low inflation rates. It is particularly vulnerable to changes in food prices. 
2.4 
Virgin Islands citizens and residents are well educated and entrepreneurial, and 
employment stood at 89.9 per cent in 2014. Expansion in tourism, financial services 
and construction, along with government initiatives to stimulate public and private 
investment, are creating new employment opportunities. 
2.5 
Looking at the period 2011-14, financial services generated the highest economic 
activity (34 per cent of GDP). The remaining percentage of GDP is split between 
tourism; information and communication; wholesale and retail trade; public 
administration; defence; social security; transportation and storage (notably the BVI 
Ports Authority); electricity (through the BVI Electricity Corporation) and water; and 
construction and quarrying. The latter has been facilitated by an improved 
transportation and telecommunications infrastructure and civil engineering works.  
2.6 
The Virgin Islands is one of the Caribbean’s leading tourism destinations and the 
hotel and restaurant sector grew by 3.9 per cent in 2011-2014. While day trippers 
fell by 10 per cent, overnight visitors increased by nine per cent to a record 386,127 
million and total visitor expenditure increased by four per cent to $458.9m.  
2.7 
The Virgin Islands is also one of the world’s leading international finance centres 
and financial services contribute 60 per cent of Government revenue. The Territory 
is well established in banking and legal services, captive insurance, company 
incorporations and re-registrations, mutual funds administration, company 
management and trust and company management. This provides significant 
employment for insurers, trust and corporate service providers (TCSPs), funds and 
investment administrators and ancillary professionals such as lawyers, accountants 
and management consultants.  
2.8 
The International Business Companies Act in 1984 was the springboard for the 
Virgin Islands’ growth, and company incorporations and re-registrations still 
 
3 
 
generate the highest revenue. The sector has remained resilient despite increased 
global competition and regulatory pressures.  
2.9 
The Virgin Islands’ laws are comprised of the common law of the United Kingdom, 
locally enacted legislation and UK Orders in Council. The Eastern Caribbean 
Supreme Court has jurisdiction and the Virgin Islands follows its jurisprudence. As 
a result, all financial services business, designated non-financial businesses and 
professions and other designated entities are subject to AML/CFT obligations in line 
with the FATF Recommendations and other international standards. 
2.10 Having a strong financial services sector is fundamental to the Virgin Islands 
Government’s long-term development strategy, and the Government has stated its 
determination to do all that is necessary to safeguard the Territory’s competitive 
position. Integral to this are maintaining a strong AML/CFT regime to address the 
risks faced by all financial centres, and sustaining the effective partnership that 
exists between Government, industry and regulator.

3. NRA methodology 
Structure of the NRA 
3.1 
The National Risk Assessment Council (NRAC) provided policy guidance and 
oversight for the NRA. Chaired by the Premier, its other members were the 
Governor, Deputy Governor, Attorney General, Managing Director/CEO of the 
Financial Services Commission, Financial Secretary and a private sector 
representative. The NRAC met every two months or more often as requested by the 
NRASG. 
3.2 
The National Risk Assessment Steering Group (NRASG), supported by a 
Secretariat, coordinated the NRA’s work. It prepared the National Risk Assessment 
Framework (NRAF), sensitised the Joint Anti-money Laundering & Terrorist 
Financing Advisory Committee (JALTFAC)1 and the Inter-governmental 
Committee on AML/CFT Matters (IGC)2, managed training, guided the Assessors 
and prepared this Report on the basis of the reports received from the Assessors. 
3.3 
Chaired by the Director of Policy Research and Statistics at the Financial Services 
Commission (FSC), five of the NRASG’s other eight members came from the FSC: 
the Deputy Managing Director of Regulation, Acting Director of Investment 
Business, Deputy Director of Fiduciary Services, Deputy Director of Policy Research 
and Statistics and Director of Finance. Other members were the Director of the 
Financial Investigation Agency (FIA), the Principal Crown Counsel in the Office of 
the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and a Detective Constable from the 
Royal Virgin Islands Police Force (RVIPF). 
3.4 
The NRASG Chairman attended the NRAC to provide guidance, advice and reports, 
and took instructions to the NRASG for implementation. This ensured a joined-up 
approach between policy-making and execution. 
3.5 
Under the NRASG came the JALTFAC, IGC, Public Education Committee (PEC) 
and Communications Committee (NRACC) – and the Assessors. 
3.6 
Thirty-eight Assessors carried out the off-site and on-site assessment. An external 
Assessor also reviewed the NRA Framework, the conduct of the NRA and the draft 
NRA, and provided guidance. 
3.7 
Assessors were mostly IGC members. To enhance transparency, independence 
and credibility, two came from the private sector to serve as independent reviewers. 
                                                          
1 The JALTFAC is a statutory, independent, public-private body which advises on AML/CFT matters. 
2 The IGC ensures domestic cooperation on AML/CFT matters. It comprises the FSC, MOF, HMC, 
Immigration Department, High Court Registry, Magistrate’s Court, BVIPA, BVIAA, IRD, Land Registry, 
ODPP, AGC, BVISR, TCAD, FIA, NPO Board, Post Office, ITA and RVIPF. 
 
 
5 
 
The Assessors were grouped into sectoral teams covering financial institutions 
(FIs)3, designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs)4, non-profit 
organisations (NPOs), competent authorities (CAs)5, law enforcement agencies 
(LEAs)6 and high value goods dealers (HVGs)7. A further team analysed 
assessment data. 
3.8 
Assessors’ training covered AML/CFT issues, FATF obligations and methodology 
and the NRA’s purpose. Assessors learned to identify and assess risks, 
vulnerabilities and potential threats and to map out consequences.  
3.9 
To facilitate the overall NRA exercise, including the workings of its various parts, an 
NRA website was established (www.bvinra.org). This enabled information to be fed 
into the NRA process and disseminated to the public.  
3.10 The Public Education Committee (PEC) undertook a campaign to make the 
general public aware of AML/CFT issues and of the NRA’s importance and progress. 
The Communications Committee (NRACC) kept key people informed about 
NRAC and NRASG decisions and worked with the PEC to encourage the public to 
provide information for the NRA. Both committees used print, online and other 
media; and the PEC developed and distributed pamphlets to schools and the 
general public. 
Data collection 
3.11 Following initial data collection through pre-assessment questionnaires (PAQs), the 
NRA’s scope was expanded to include key governmental and non-governmental 
institutions as these might have vulnerabilities that might prevent implementation of 
the sectoral recommendations. The NRA exercise thus went beyond the usual pure 
risk assessment by considering all the areas considered relevant to ensuring full 
compliance with AML/CFT obligations.  
3.12 Where any deficiencies were identified, this was not intended as an indictment but 
as an encouragement to take the necessary steps to ensure the strongest possible 
AML/CFT defence. 
3.13 In Phase I, to inform the onsite visits, PAQs were distributed to financial FIs, 
DNFBPs, NPOs, CAs and HVGs. No specific PAQs were developed for LEAs as 
the NRASG felt these should be fully reviewed in Phase II, considering how inter-
                                                          
3 FIs include banks, trust and corporate service providers (TCSPs), insurance companies, and investment 
business and insolvency practitioners 
4 DNFBPs include lawyers, accountants, real estate agents 
5 CAs cover the Attorney General’s Chambers, Governor’s Office, Financial Services Commission, 
Financial Investigation Agency and International Tax Authority 
6 LEAs are the Immigration Department, HMC, RVIPF, ODPP, BVIAA, BVIPA, MC and HC 
7 HVGs are furniture dealers, car dealers, yacht brokers and jewellers 
 
6 
 
related they were. However, the PAQs included questions specific to the Office of 
the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and the Royal Virgin Islands Police 
Force (RVIPF). 
3.14 While private sector completion of the PAQs was voluntary, the Association of RAs 
and BVI Accounting Association urged their members to do so. Radio and online 
advertisements also encouraged participation. To encourage frankness, the NRA’s 
independence and confidentiality were stressed and participants were assured their 
information would not be shared with any supervisory authority. A total of 485 PAQs 
were distributed and 193 responses were received, representing a response rate of 
39.8%. 
Pre-assessment questionnaires (PAQS) 
The PAQs explored: 
 
International cooperation issues relevant to CAs – international treaties, mutual 
legal assistance, freezing and confiscation, extradition, sanctions and other forms of 
international cooperation 
 
Regulation and supervision – the supervisory powers of the FSC and FIA, human 
resource capacity, handling of wire transfers, introduced business, new technologies, 
PEPs and beneficial ownership of legal persons/arrangements 
 
Internal controls, operational risk factors, record keeping requirements, AML/CFT 
compliance and handing of STRs by FIs, NPOs, DNFBPs and HVGs (as a sub-set of 
DNFBPs) 
 
How FIs and DNFBPs cooperate internationally by responding to and processing 
information requests from domestic CAs 
 
Law enforcement (including ML, TF, PF, tipping-off, targeted financial sanctions, 
predicate offences and confiscation), how the FIA functions as an FIU (which includes 
powers to collect, analyse and disseminate STRs, investigative powers and human 
resource capacity)  
 
National, intra-agency cooperation and coordination on AML/CFT matters. 
The questionnaires were available on an official NRA website (www.bvinra.org) and emailed 
to all entities on record within the identified sectors. To ensure legitimacy, a declaration 
required the name and email address of the person completing the PAQ. 
3.15 In Phase II, Assessors conducted 237 onsite interviews. As well as specific 
questions, these used the responses in Phase I to gather missing data, verify key 
information and compare what entities said with what they had written. 
3.16 Assessors also drew on quantitative and qualitative data from other sources such 
as the IMF, Global Forum, FATF and Caribbean FATF (CFATF), as well as the 
Virgin Islands’ FIA and IGC and LEAs, CAs, FIs, DNFBPs and NPOs. A data 
analysis team undertook in-depth analysis of the findings and ensured a consistent 
approach.

Risk analysis 
3.17 The risk analysis methodology applied the same mechanisms across AML, TF and 
proliferation financing (PF), given that criminals use the same or similar ways to 
raise or move funds. It assumed that criminals could launder money and finance 
terrorism through any sector as even low risk ones might, without attention, become 
susceptible to ML, TF or PF. The analysis took account of frameworks such as the 
NRA Framework and relevant literature from the World Bank.  
Methodology for risk analysis  
Criteria included whether reporting entities, CAs and LEAs had robust controls to identify 
and mitigate ML/TF risk; whether measures were commensurate with the risks identified; 
the types of Virgin Islands criminal activity that were ML/TF predicate offences; and the 
extent of cooperation to mitigate ML/TF risks. 
Factors included assessment by LEAs, the relevant regulators and CAs; and the Territory’s 
international cooperation mechanisms. Private sector input was used in assessing FIs, 
DNFBPs, HVGs and NPOs. 
Risk weightings were given to individual PAQ questions based on their ML/TF impact on 
the BVI: a 50 per cent impact was high; 30 per cent medium to high; 15 per cent medium to 
low; and five per cent low. Each question was then risk-rated one for low, four for medium 
and seven for high. The same was done for onsite visit responses. 
A weighted risk average was arrived at by comparing PAQ and onsite responses: 1.00–
3.00 for low risk, 3.01–6.00 for medium risk and 6.01 and above for high risk. 
Applying ratings to the data enabled a risk profiling of individual questions (for issues 
across an entire sector and/or agencies), specific groups of questions (governance, 
records, STRs, etc.), individual respondents (to identify any outliers), sectoral sub-
groupings (to assess any greater risks), and individual sectors (high, medium or low risk). 
 
Reporting 
3.18 Each team drafted a sectoral report, explaining the methodology used and being 
consistent across sectors (unless otherwise explained). The reports stated the risks, 
threats, vulnerabilities and consequences identified, and recommended mitigation. 
NRASG members reviewed the reports for quality and consistency. 
3.19 NRASG consolidated the sectoral reports into a final report. It met with the CAs and 
LEAs individually to ensure there were no factual inaccuracies and to clarify and 
close gaps. The final Report was then reviewed by a domestic independent 
Reviewer for quality and consistency and submitted to the external Assessor for his 
review and recommendations, before being finalised by the NRASG.

4. Domestic advisory bodies 
4.1 
In line with FATF Recommendation Two and under the Anti-money Laundering and 
Terrorist Financing Code of Practice, 2008 (AMLTFCOP), the authorities and 
mechanisms below develop, implement and coordinate national AML/CFT policies 
in the BVI. 
4.2 
The Joint Anti-money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Advisory 
Committee (JALTFAC) advises the FSC on AML/CFT initiatives and has 15 public 
and private sector members.8 It performs to a generally high standard and its 
quarterly (or more frequent) meetings are in-depth and robust. Work is ongoing to 
increase public outreach and attendance at meetings. 
4.3 
The Inter-Governmental Committee on AML/CFT Matters (IGC) raises public 
awareness of ML/TF issues and fosters AML/CFT cooperation between key 
agencies and with overseas AML/CFT agencies.9 Its members (15 in the 2011-14 
review period10) meet every quarter or as required. Attendance at IGC meetings and 
the provision of statistical data to the IGC has improved. An important area for 
improvement is for the IGC to undertake meaningful analysis of the data to identify 
AML/CFT trends and typologies.  
4.4 
It is unclear what impact the IGC has had on improving the AML/CFT framework or 
awareness of ML/TF risks. A limitation is that the JALTFAC and IGC are not 
responsible for coordinating the national AML/CFT regime in line with FATF 
Recommendations One and Two. It would be helpful to establish a national body 
that directs and coordinates all AML/CFT issues at the domestic level. 
4.5 
The FSC and FIA promote IGC cooperation and private sector dialogue to build a 
broad-based awareness of ML/TF matters and information sharing. 
 
 
                                                          
8 The JALTFAC was established by the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997, Section 27A (1). 
9 The IGC was established under powers granted to the FSC and FIA by the AMLTFCOP, Section 50 (1).  
10 In 2015, the addition of HC, MC, IR and Land Registry brought membership to 19.

5. Legal persons and arrangements 
5.1 
We set out here the legal framework and regulatory regime for establishing and 
supervising legal persons and arrangements in the BVI, and combating misuse. The 
international cooperation framework and how information on legal persons and 
arrangements is gathered are addressed in the sections of this Report that deal with 
the FSC, FIA, ITA, GO, RVIPF and AGC. 
5.2 
The Virgin Islands is not alone among IFCs in being susceptible to the abuse of its 
corporate structures by unscrupulous persons for nefarious purposes. Through 
effective supervision, it seeks to ensure that lawful vehicles for business 
development and transactions are not abused for ML, TF and other crime.  
5.3 
As the responsible CA and in line with FATF requirements, the FSC combats abuse 
by: licensing persons allowed to carry on activities such as incorporating and 
registering companies and establishing trusts; subjecting licensees to the full 
AML/CFT regime and requiring them to carry out full customer due diligence (CDD) 
on all business incorporations and registrations and ongoing business relationships; 
and inspecting licensees regularly to establish and ensure CDD compliance. 
Companies 
5.4 
Companies are governed by the BVI Business Companies Act (BVIBCA). Section 5 
allows for five types of company: limited by shares; limited by guarantee and not 
authorised to issue shares; limited by guarantee and authorised to issue shares; 
unlimited and not authorised to issue shares; and unlimited and authorised to issue 
shares.  
5.5 
A company may undertake any business activity and transaction and may issue and 
hold shares (including bearer shares). At the end of 2014, there were 457,971 active 
companies incorporated or registered. 
5.6 
Only a registered agent (RA) can apply to incorporate a company. Documents filed 
must include the memorandum and articles of association and formal consent by 
the proposed RA to act. The Registrar then registers the documents by allotting a 
company number and issuing a certificate of incorporation.  
5.7 
Foreign companies can register under their corporate name or an alternative. At this 
time, they must provide evidence of incorporation, a certified copy of their 
constitutional instrument, a list of directors and details of their appointed RA. 
5.8 
As regards ownership and control, these may be vested in natural or legal persons. 
A register of members must be maintained, with names and addresses of registered 
shareholders and the number of each class and series of shares. Following the 
 
10 
 
NRA, since 2016, companies have had to file an up-to-date copy of their directors’ 
register with the Registrar, in line with FATF Recommendation 24.11  
5.9 
A BVI Business Company (BVIBC) must have a registered office and agent in the 
BVI. The RA must maintain the memorandum and articles, registers of members 
and directors and copies of all filings. The company itself must keep records of its 
transactions and financial position in hard copy or electronic form in line with the 
Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters) Act (MLA(TM)A). Where records are 
maintained outside the BVI, the RA must know the address and who has control.  
5.10 A limited liability company can issue bearer shares, which must be immobilized and 
deposited with authorized or recognized custodians in or outside the BVI, along with 
ownership identification. The FSC has approved 11 persons (four foreign) as 
authorized custodians and 11 institutions as recognized custodians. Since July 
2012, RAs within the Virgin Islands have had to maintain full information on the 
owners of bearer shares, obtaining this from the person depositing the shares or the 
custodian. As at December 2014, 275 companies were authorised to issue bearer 
shares, a decrease from 323 in 2012. 
5.11 The FSC carried out onsite inspections in 2010-2013 to verify that all authorised 
custodians’ record-keeping was compliant. The FSC does not inspect recognised 
custodians as they must be investment exchanges or clearing organisations in an 
FATF member jurisdiction, where they are normally supervised to high standards. 
5.12 Given the limited number of companies that can issue bearer shares and the 
mechanisms for immobilizing bearer shares, CAs and LEAs (such as the FSC, FIA, 
ITA and RVIPF) are satisfied the risk these shares pose has been contained. They 
have found it straightforward to secure information on people behind bearer shares.  
5.13 With respect to striking off from the Register, a company may be struck off where it 
does not have an RA, fails to make a required filing, has ceased business, is 
undertaking an unlicensed activity or fails to pay its annual fee or a late payment 
penalty. In 2014, 53,408 companies were struck off and as of Q3 2015 the number 
was 20,730. The number of struck-off companies for which RAs remain active is not 
known but is believed to be large. 
5.14 A struck-off company ceases to function as a legal entity. The company, directors, 
members and any liquidator or receiver cannot undertake any activity or deal with 
the assets unless they apply for the company to be restored. However, striking it off 
does not prevent the company incurring liabilities or being pursued for a claim, and 
the directors, members, officers or agents remain liable.  
5.15 A company may be restored to the Register within seven years and is then deemed 
never to have been struck off. Reasons for restoration include inadvertency in failing 
to pay a fee; bringing, defending or continuing a claim; asset disposal; and winding 
                                                          
11 BVI Business Companies (Amendment) Act, 2015, which came into force 1 January 2016. 
 
11 
 
down specific transactions. A refusal by the Registrar to restore may be appealed 
to the High Court. 
5.16 Even if an RA resigns as agent, a struck-off company’s registered address invariably 
remains the RA’s to ensure that documents can be served there. RAs can on 
occasion refuse documents for a struck-off company where their business 
relationship has not formally ended. This potentially inhibits the Virgin Islands’ ability 
to meet its international cooperation obligations. 
5.17 CDD under the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997 (PCCA), Anti-money 
Laundering Regulations, 2008 (AMLR) and AMLTFCOP requires customer and 
beneficial owners to be identified and verified, and the purpose and intended nature 
of the business relationship to be understood. All CDD information must be 
maintained for at least five years. All legal persons must regularly update this – 
annually for high-risk businesses and for low risks every three years (extended to 
four years in 2016).  
5.18 One area for improvement for RAs lie in updating information for struck-off 
companies from the termination date if this falls earlier than the regular review 
(struck-off companies are published in the Gazette). Another lies in recording the 
date of the strike off and the (later) date on which the CDD information was updated, 
as losing contact with the directors/principals can make review difficult. 
5.19 The Virgin Islands is considering streamlining and clarifying the BVIBCA’s striking 
off provisions to clarify the obligations of an RA in relation to a struck-off company, 
in order to ensure clear parameters for rendering MLA with respect to such 
companies.   
Trusts and partnerships 
5.20 Trust service business is regulated and subject to AML/CFT legislative provisions, 
with due diligence required on trusts and other legal arrangements.12 In the final 
quarter of 2014, there were 226 licensed trust service businesses.  
5.21 Limited partnerships may be formed under the Partnership Act, 1966. Articles of 
partnership must be submitted to the RA and a memorandum of partnership to the 
Registrar, the latter stating: the partnership’s name, objects and purposes; the RA’s 
name and address; the registered office in the Virgin Islands and general partner; 
and terms and conditions.  
5.22 A limited partnership must maintain a registered office and RA in the BVI. The office 
must hold the name, address, amounts and contribution dates (both money in and 
returned) for each partner. The limited partnership is required to keep its own 
accounts and financial records. The legislation does not as yet provide for the 
obligations of a general partnership, which is an area for improvement.  
                                                          
12 Under the Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990 (BTCA) and the AMLTFCOP and AMLR respectively. 
 
12 
 
Financial Services Commission 
5.23 The FSC regulates and supervises the Virgin Islands’ financial services sector (see 
page 21 below for details).13 This covers banking, insurance, mutual funds, 
investment business, trust and corporate service providers (TCSPs), financing and 
money service providers and insolvency practitioners. The FSC also approves 
authorised custodians and representatives, directors, senior officers and other 
independent officers. 
5.24 The FSC takes a risk-based approach, determine the frequency and level of 
supervision by assigning a high, medium or low risk rating to each licensed entity. 
This risk assessment incorporates the FATF Recommendations and other 
international standards.14 It looks at where the entity physically operates and at its 
products and who they are offered to. 
5.25 The Virgin Islands carries out AML/CFT oversight of legal persons and 
arrangements by regulating and supervising TCSPs who act as RAs. The FSC 
licenses and supervises RAs to the level of a financial institution, in line with FATF 
Recommendations.  
5.26 TCSPs must risk-assess the BVIBCs for which they act as agents. The FSC checks 
they are doing so through periodic inspections. This enables some identification of 
the ML/TF risk of transacting business wherever the company operates (see 
Section 7 for a more detailed analysis of TCSPs, including RAs). 
5.27 The Registry of Corporate Affairs (ROCA), an FSC division, ensures that 
companies doing business in and from within the Virgin Islands are incorporated or 
registered. A company incorporated in the Virgin Islands may carry on business 
anywhere in the world where not prohibited. As a result, foreign regulators or law 
enforcement agencies may request information about it. This mainly takes place 
through the gateway provisions of the FSCA and through Memorandums of 
Understanding (MoUs), tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) and mutual 
legal assistance treaties (MLATs). The information available includes all that filed 
with the ROCA and any other maintained by the company or its RA.  
5.28 For non-regulated entities, the FSC assesses risk by regulating and supervising 
their RAs, who must undertake CDD and other AML/CFT checks and understand 
their entities’ business activities. The FSC uses onsite inspection to understand 
entities’ risk, looking at their business and their AML/CFT compliance.  
                                                          
13 The Financial Services Commission Act, 2001 (FSCA) sets out the FSC’s functions, which include 
monitoring of compliance by licensees with the AMLTFCOP and with other ML/TF-related Acts, 
regulations, codes or guidelines. 
14 These include the BCP, IAIS CP, IOSCO PSR and Group of International Finance Centre Supervisors 
(GIFCS) SBP.  
 
13 
 
5.29 The FSC also monitors daily a wide range of information sources which might 
indicate involvement by a BVIBC in an FATF predicate offence, the only CA or LEA 
to do so.  
5.30 The FSC takes enforcement action against breaches of AML/CFT laws (see 
Sections 6 and 7 for details), mainly in the form of warnings and imposition of 
administrative penalties.

6. Competent authorities 
6.1 
This section considers the Virgin Islands’ five Competent Authorities (CAs): the 
Governor’s Office, Attorney General’s Chambers, Financial Investigation Agency, 
Financial Services Commission and International Tax Authority. 
Risks 
High  
 
Handling of incoming and outgoing extradition requests 
 
SAR/STR processing 
 
Time taken to complete AML/CFT compliance inspections 
Medium  
Handling of outgoing information requests from local CAs 
 
Handling of incoming MLA requests from overseas CAs 
 
Ability to process incoming requests for High Court evidence 
 
Prosecutions and convictions resulting from assistance provided 
 
Handling of investigations stemming from MLA requests 
 
Court challenges to incoming requests from overseas CAs 
 
Difficulties in processing MLA requests 
 
Ability to monitor BVIBCs for ML/TF 
6.2 
The CAs are generally carrying out their functions at an appreciable level. Areas to 
address include resources and expertise, the appropriate collection of statistical 
data to assess effectiveness, and overall compliance with international standards, 
particularly the FATF’s Recommendations and tax-related information exchange 
agreements. 
Governor’s Office

6.3 
The Governor is Her Majesty’s representative in the Virgin Islands and in that 
capacity also serves her Majesty’s interests. He is responsible for security and 
governance, including extradition, and is the competent authority for the receipt and 
processing of incoming and outgoing MLA requests. He chairs Cabinet but is not a 
member and cannot vote. Five of the eleven Governor’s Office (GO) staff deal with 
MLA and extradition matters. All staff take an oath of confidentiality and are 
governed by the General Orders of the Public Service and the Public Service 
Regulations (“public service rules”). 
 
 
15 
 
6.4 
Both the GO and the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) act on MLA and 
extradition matters. There is opportunity to improve communication between the GO 
and AGC on MLA and extradition matters to ensure that the GO is aware of requests 
sent directly to the AGC and how the AGC is progressing these, as well as to avoid 
anomalies over numbers. Following the NRA, the GO and AGC have procedures for 
keeping each other informed of requests: further coordination would be helpful. 
6.5 
The GO would benefit from more specialist training for staff with MLA and extradition 
matters and from more detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
requests (eg separate logging of MLA and extradition requests). 
6.6 
UN or EU sanctions are extended to the Virgin Islands through UK Government 
Orders in Council and published in the BVI Gazette and on the FIA and FSC’s 
websites. Following the NRA, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office communicates 
Orders two weeks before UK publication and HM Treasury provides a daily updated 
list to avoid any risk of sanctioned persons continuing their activity. 
6.7 
The GO has a records management policy and all files are classified and kept 
secure. It also maintains independent computer systems for its respective Foreign & 
Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Virgin Islands Government activity (the latter 
including MLA and extradition). Maintaining all information electronically would 
make it easier to locate files quickly and track any access granted.  
6.8 
Following the NRA, an FCO review has made specific recommendations to improve 
the physical security of the GO building. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the GO 
T 
 
Criminals’ ability not to be extradited due to procedural failures in the extradition 
process. 
 
Criminals’ ability to retain proceeds of crime where there is inability to provide 
information through MLATs. 
V 
 
Poor communication between the GO and AGC on MLA and extradition matters 
increases the risk of criminals not being extradited and hence retaining the proceeds 
of crime, and ultimately not being brought to justice. 
 
Lack of clearly defined SOPs for MLAs and extraditions leads to inconsistency in the 
way staff deal with matters. This affects timing and the proper execution of MLAs that 
could lead to extraditions.

6.9 
The Attorney General (AG) is the Government’s principal legal adviser and sits ex 
officio in Cabinet and in the House of Assembly. The AG’s independence is assured 
under The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007. The AG’s Chambers (AGC) has 
five sections: accounts, administration, civil litigation, law reform commission and 
legislative drafting. Staff take an oath of confidentiality and are governed by public 
service rules and by lawyers’ professional ethics.  
6.10 The AGC is a member of the IGC and JALTFAC. It is the central authority for US 
MLA, while the GO is the central authority for MLA to and from other countries.15 
With the CFATF, the AG has overall policy direction and coordination and is the 
CFATF’s Prime Contact in the Virgin Islands. The FSC leads on technical 
issues.Since the NRA, the AGC and GO have agreed a notification procedure for 
matters concerning MLA requests: further enhancements to their communication 
would be helpful. The AGC has an SOP that guides staff on MLA duties. Swifter 
processing of extradition and MLA requests could be achieved by having an internal 
policy and written procedures for handling MLA and extradition requests, providing 
in-depth training for key staff and filling vacant posts. Effective security measures 
are in place, and improvements to equipment and access were made in January 
2016. 
6.11 The BVI’s extradition regime is administered by the GO with the advice and 
assistance of the AGC. Extradition requests are dealt with in accordance with 
established treaties and the governing local law. 
 
 
                                                          
15 This is under the MLA (USA) A and CJ (IC) A and PCCA respectively. 
 
 
17 
 
Extradition from and to the BVI 
The Governor receives requests for extradition from the BVI. He consults the AGC 
on whether these meet the Virgin Islands’ legal requirements. The AGC is expected 
to inform the GO of requests it receives directly. Where a request is valid and 
contested, the AGC takes it through the judicial process. The AGC works closely with 
the police, for example in detaining the subjects of requests. 
The BVI received seven extradition requests over the review period. Five were 
contested and sent to the AGC; none related directly to ML/TF. Two were not 
contested and the GO dealt with them directly. 
When seeking an extradition to the BVI, the ODPP forwards a request to the AGC, 
which vets it and submits it for the Governor's signature. The GO sends the request 
back to the AGC, which forwards it to the Deputy Governor for an apostille. The 
request then returns to the AGC, which confirms all steps have been complied with 
and submits the completed request to the GO for onward transmission via diplomatic 
channels. 
At the time of the NRA, the Extradition (Overseas Territories) Order 2002 governed 
extradition requests. Since 9 November 2016, the Extradition Act 2003 (Overseas 
Territories) Order 2016 has provided for a more flexible procedure. 
6.12 Opportunities for the AGC to be more proactive include asking CAs for feedback on 
the information it has sent, entering into MoUs with overseas CAs, requesting 
clarification of unclear requests, and recommending reforms to the Virgin Islands’ 
laws. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the AGC 
T 
 
Criminals’ ability to retain proceeds of crime where there is inability to provide 
information through MLATs. 
 
Unauthorised persons accessing information due to inadequate file management 
system and storage. 
 
The absence of an orderly to provide the AG with security may place sensitive 
government material and information at risk if the AG’s personal security is 
compromised. 
V 
 
The records for MLAs and extraditions within the AGC and the GO do not correspond 
with each other (MLA records for AGC are mostly more current). This suggests a 
breakdown within the system, which can affect efficiency when handling international 
cooperation matters. 
 
Poor communication between the GO and AGC on MLA and extradition matters. 
 
Lack of written procedures and of training in dealing with local and overseas law 
enforcement requests can contribute to unnecessary delays in processing extradition 
requests. 
 
The significant number of vacant posts leads to a lack of sufficient resources for the 
processing of MLAs, including those related to confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

6.13 The Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) is a statutory body established under the 
FIA Act (FIAA) which functions autonomously and independently of Government.16 
Its Board consists of the Deputy Governor (Chairman), AG (Deputy Chairman), 
Financial Secretary, Commissioner of Police, Commissioner of Customs, MD/CEO 
of the FSC and FIA Director (ex officio). The Board meets annually with Cabinet. 
6.14 The FIA is a fully participating member of the Egmont Group of financial intelligence 
units (FIUs) and the CFATF Working Group on FIUs. All staff and the Board take an 
oath of confidentiality and are governed by public service rules.  
6.15 The FIA is a hybrid FIU in that it both analyses and investigates Suspicious Activity 
Reports/Suspicious Transaction Reports (SARs/STRs). A Steering Committee 
receives all STR reports from, and advises, the Director. The committee’s value 
should be clarified, given how sparingly it meets and that the Director effectively 
carries out its work. 
6.16 Staff receive extensive, expert training relevant to their job, including foreign FIU 
attachments for supervisory staff.  
6.17 Security is good. Access to the FIA’s office and filing rooms is restricted and can be 
accessed only by key card. Other physical measures are in place. The FIA has 
adequate technological resources and has four servers, including an offsite server 
for daily backup. Access to its databases is limited to the staff that use them and 
none of the databases is connected to the internet. Records are stored in hard copy 
in a secure area, backed up offsite electronically and scanned in. Physical 
separation between supervision and investigation (which did not exist) would ensure 
that SAR/STR information was fully secure.  
6.18 The FIA has signed MoUs with the FSC, RVIPF, HMC and the Virgin Islands 
Shipping Registry (VISR), and in 2014 signed a Multilateral Memorandum of 
Understanding (MMoU) with all IGC members. It has not proactively used these, 
although the FSC has used its MoU in relation to the FIA on a number of occasions, 
largely to conduct its fit and proper assessment of persons it considers for approval.  
                                                          
16 Its ML/TF/PF authority is derived from the FIAA and other legislation, principally the PCCA, 
AMLTFCOP and PF(P)A but also the AMLR, AT(UNOM)(OT)O and AT(FOM)(OT)O. 
 
19 
 
6.19 The FIA assists overseas CAs investigate ML/TF and related predicate offences, 
usually through Egmont membership or MoUs with specified countries. The FIA 
actively seeks MoUs with relevant CAs and has not yet been refused. It has MoUs 
with Australia, Canada, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, 
Poland, Russia, St Maarten and Taiwan 
6.20 Search warrants to obtain information can be issued following MLAT requests to the 
FIA via the AGC. Over the review period, 209 search warrants were issued and 
none was refused; and the FIA responded to 1,403 information requests from 
Egmont members, with a response time of between 22-28 and 29-60 days.  
6.21 Increasing the skilled staff in the FIA’s Analysis and Investigative Units would benefit 
the extent and speed of investigations of SARs/STRs, the supervision of compliance 
and responding to the large volume of overseas requests. 
Steps for handling SARs/STRs 
1. The SARs/STRs are filed by regulated or non-regulated entities. 
2. They are assigned a unique reference number and an official receipt is sent within 48 
hours of them being received. 
An Analyst reviews the information and the FIA obtains any additional information from 
the source of the SAR/STR or any other entity or individual. 
The FIA has the power to request information from all regulated as well as non-regulated 
entities. If these prove recalcitrant, rather than prosecute, the FIA refers them to the 
FSC for action, such as the imposition of administrative penalty. Cabinet is considering 
empowering the FIA to impose administrative penalties. 
The Analyst then draws conclusions about the type(s) of criminal offences and makes 
any recommendations to the Deputy Director, Analysis and Investigations or the 
Director. Both have AML/CFT training and police powers of arrest, search, seizure and 
investigation.  
The recommendations generally comprise one or more of: (a) refer the case to the 
RVIPF for them to take any action they deem necessary; (b) refer the contents of the 
SARs/STRs to FIUs in the Egmont Group for intelligence purposes or for them to take 
action; or (c) close the file and store the information in the FIA database for information 
or intelligence.  
The information can be shared with other entities for intelligence purposes within FIAA 
restrictions (rights of third parties, including the maker and subject(s) of the SAR/STR; 
and use of the information). Because of their strict protocols on using it, information is 
generally only exchanged with Egmont members.  
3. The Deputy Director either approves the conclusions or refers the SAR/STR back to the 
Analyst. He may also refer SARs/STRs to the Director for advice. 
The findings go to the RVIPF’s FCU other domestic agencies or Egmont FIUs 
 
20 
 
4. The Director sends written feedback to the maker of the SAR/STR, with as much detail 
as possible on the FIA’s action as well as any outcomes. The timing of feedback is 
relative as SAR/STRs require varying analysis and investigation.  
6.22 Although the FIA supervises NPOs, not all known NPOs have yet registered with 
the NPO Board. The Board is actively engaging with those who have not. 
6.23 The FIA receives and reviews compliance manuals from DNFBP and NPO entities. 
To ascertain issues or risks within particular sectors, it would be useful to maintain 
statistics on the categories of DNFBPs that have filed manuals. The FIA would also 
benefit from greater resources to review the manuals. In 2011-14, it received 256 
and reviewed and approved 196. 
6.24 As there is no requirement for DNFBPs and HVGs to register, the FIA assesses who 
to supervise on the basis of information from the Department of Trade and 
Consumer Affairs, which has an impact on the timing and certainty of supervision.  
6.25 The FIA is developing a more thorough risk assessment framework following the 
NRA. In the review period, SARs/STRs could not always be investigated in the year 
they were received. There was no confiscation of proceeds of crime or identification 
of when ML/TF occurred. Opportunity exists for greater cooperation between the 
FIA, RVIPF and ODPP in the process, from the identification to the prosecution of 
possible ML offences. 
6.26 Entities submitting SARs/STRs have a challenging five days to respond to the FIA’s 
request for information and can apply for an extension. Maintaining statistics would 
help ascertain whether extensions were granted appropriately.  
6.27 Obtaining feedback from overseas CAs after giving them information would help the 
FIA judge its effectiveness. It would also be useful to keep reporting entities better 
informed, as the FIA is required to do. 
6.28 Staff understand their legal obligations in relation to conflicts of interest and 
corruption despite no apparent training in the specific elements of these or of PF. 
6.29 The FIA’s SOP manual does not always reflect current practice and dates from 
November 2012. The FIA would benefit from having a documented procedure for 
document control and management, with regular review and revision. 
 
 
 
21 
 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the FIA 
T 
 
Insufficient staff assigned to handle supervisory activities, conduct regular AML/CFT 
inspections and assigned to analyse, investigate and disseminate SARs/STRs and 
the relevant information. 
 
Failure of coordination between key offices, especially the FIA and the RVIPF (and 
the RVIPF and the ODPP) inhibits the proper investigation and prosecution of ML 
matters. 
 
Filing of poor quality SARs/STRs by financial institutions and DNFBPs makes 
investigations and analyses difficult and leads to waste of resources. 
 
Security of premises and lack of physical separation of analysts and investigative staff 
from other staff could lead to compromised data.  
V 
 
A lack of fully skilled staff trained in investigative techniques, to analyse SARs/STRs 
and to supervise and monitor DNFBPs could leave the BVI unable to provide 
meaningful international cooperation and detect ML/TF activities overall, which could 
lead to criminals avoiding prosecution. 
 
Absence of strategic analysis of data collected means the FIA is unable to identify 
trends in ML/TF and put mechanisms in place to reduce the risks posed by those 
engaging in such activities. 
 
Lack of sufficient feedback means that entities who submit SARs/STRs may not be in 
a position to improve their risk assessment and techniques to identify persons who 
may be engaged in ML/TF or pose a high risk of doing so.

6.30 The FSCA establishes the FSC as an autonomous statutory body and it functions 
and operates independently. The FSC has powers to regulate and supervise 
financial services businesses17 which are licensed, authorised or approved to carry 
out business in and from within the BVI. The FSC’s independence is buttressed by 
how it is funded.18  
                                                          
17 The FSCA defines “financial services business” as any business or activity which requires a licence 
from the FSC or which is so specified in regulations made under the FSCA. Licenses are generally 
required to engage in banking, TCSPs, insurance, financing and money services business, insolvency 
practice and investment business.  
18 The FSCA establishes a Government Trust Account into which monies collected by the FSC are paid. 
The FSC retains not less than 7½ and not more than 15 per cent a year. 
 
22 
 
6.31 The FSC has nine divisions: Banking and Fiduciary Services, Corporate Services, 
Human Resources, Insolvency Services, Insurance, Investment Business, Legal 
and Enforcement, Policy, Research and Statistics and Registry of Corporate Affairs 
(ROCA). 
6.32 The FSC’s Board is appointed by, and responsible to, Cabinet. It comprises a 
Chairman and six to eight other Commissioners appointed for two or three years, 
with the MD/CEO serving as an ex officio member. At least two non-ex officio 
members must be people from outside the Virgin Islands with financial services 
qualifications and experience. All members must be fit and proper and have suitable 
expertise. To ensure transparency and non-interference, a Commissioner may only 
be removed by Cabinet following established criteria, with reasons published in the 
Gazette.  
6.33 While the MD/CEO has day-to-day responsibility, the Board, which meets monthly, 
is the overall governing body, approving policies, monitoring implementation, 
overseeing overall management and approving the accounts, estimates and work 
programme. It gives an annual account to Cabinet of its stewardship and presents 
its work programme for the following year.  
6.34 The FSC has an MoU with the FIA and is a signatory to the IGC MMoU, as is the 
RVIPF, which cooperates with the FSC. The FSC is the central authority for 
international cooperation on regulatory and financial services supervisory matters, 
and the MD/CEO is the contact person. 
6.35 There are three operational committees. 
 
The 
statutory 
Licensing 
and 
Supervisory 
Committee 
functions 
independently and has its own guidelines and operating procedures. It meets 
weekly at least 50 times a year. 
 
The statutory Enforcement Committee functions independently and has its 
own guidelines and operating procedures for dealing with breaches, including 
AML/CFT ones. It generally meets weekly but less often than the LSC (there 
are fewer enforcement actions than licensing applications). It publishes 
enforcement actions. 
 
The Crisis Management Group meets when there is a matter to address and 
did not meet during the review period. In 2013, it drafted a procedure manual, 
which is being finalised. It was renamed the Business Risk Group in April 
2016. 
6.36 The Financial Services Appeal Board is part of the FSC’s governance structure 
but functions independently. For the review period, it had five members appointed 
by the Cabinet. It meets only to determine appeals against FSC decisions. Some 
NRA concerns about transparency and independence were addressed by the 
Financial Services Appeal Board Act, 2016, which completely removes the Financial 
Services Appeal Board from the FSC’s direct governance structure. 
 
23 
 
6.37 In the review period, staff numbers increased by 15 per cent to 155. Some 28 per 
cent were dedicated to supervision and two per cent to investigation. Further 
expansion of the Compliance Inspection Unit and the Fiduciary Services Division 
would assist the FSC’s policy of inspecting each licensee in a four-year cycle and 
understanding fully the non-compliance risk that licensees pose. 
6.38 The Enforcement Unit investigates legislative breaches and monitors companies 
that may be involved in ML/TF and other criminal activities. Staffing fell during the 
review period but was increased to four in 2016 and this may be reviewed further. 
6.39 In the review period, only the FSC’s Board of Commissioners had to make a 
declaration of interests. In 2015, the FSC developed a conflicts of interest framework 
and amended its staff code of conduct accordingly. 
6.40 The FSC provides very robust regulatory and AML/CFT training. This combines 
theory and practice and extends beyond compliance inspectors to ROCA staff. 
Assessments at the end of each session help determine effectiveness, as do 
external training certificates and qualifications. Some ten staff a year get external 
AML/CFT/PF training and staff are also trained overseas.  
6.41 The FSC’s records management combines electronic and paper records. Measures 
are in place to reduce the risk of security breaches. Files are accessible 
electronically and in hard copy, kept in a secure location. A mirrored server 
automatically backs up data. Greater technological resources would enhance record 
keeping and the generation of statistics. 
6.42 An RFID document management system allows files to be easily located and 
delivered. This is logged and the files are returned by the end of the day. 
6.43 The FSC applies a risk-based approach to regulation and supervision and assesses 
risk on multiple levels, ranging from the ML/TF susceptibility of services and 
products within the Virgin Islands to standards established by the FATF, 
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS), International Association of Insurance Supervisors 
(IAIS), Group of International Finance Centre Supervisors (GIFCS) and other 
international bodies.  
6.44 The FSC’s risk assessment mechanisms are set out in onsite inspections manuals, 
procedures manuals and risk assessment forms and guidance. A single document 
for the entire risk assessment framework could ensure that all those involved in risk 
assessment applied the required criteria. 
6.45 When an entity is licensed, it receives a risk assessment and a low, medium or high 
rating for prudential and AML/CFT compliance. A high-risk firm will be inspected 
annually or more frequently. Low-risk entities should normally be assessed once 
every three to four years but this is not always the case. Areas for improvement 
include continuous updates of risk assessments and having a written follow-up 
procedure. 
 
24 
 
6.46 Licensees must appoint FSC-approved compliance officers, who provide annual 
reports to the FSC. A coordinated review system would increase the reports’ value 
in enhancing the enforcement process. 
6.47 Depending on licensees’ size, inspections may run from three days to two weeks, 
with a follow-up inspection within six months. Licensees are invited to comment on 
the first draft of a inspection report. In the review period, due to limited resources in 
the Compliance Inspections Unit, issuing the report took from four months to two 
and a half years and some licensees took corrective action beforehand. Reports 
were completed more quickly in 2014 but some still took nearly a year. Finalizing 
reports no more than six weeks after an inspection would give them real value. 
6.48 The FSC can take enforcement action for breaches of the AMLTFCOP and AMLR; 
conducting business detrimental to public, client, creditor or investor interest; 
violating financial services legislation; failure to comply with an FSC directive; 
breaching a licence; or giving the FSC false information. It can suspend, cancel or 
revoke a licence, impose administrative penalties, issue a warning letter or an order 
to cease business, or appoint an examiner. Actions may be appealed through the 
Financial Services Appeal Board. 
6.49 In the review period, the FCS took 281 enforcement actions, of which 57 (20 per 
cent) were for AML/CFT matters. Of those, 45 penalties related to AML infractions 
and none to TF. The majority of those penalised were TCSPs.  
6.50 A total of 93 cases attracted administrative penalties to the value of $1,195,100. 
Since the NRA, the FSC has designated a separate account for these funds and is 
developing a policy for their use.  
6.51 In the review period, the FSC followed clear written policies and procedures to 
receive and make MLA requests. It only declined three out of 421 processed 
requests, demonstrating its commitment to international information exchange. 
6.52 When the FSC requests information from overseas CAs, the average response time 
is 29-60 days against an industry standard of within 21 days. The FSC’s own 
response time to foreign requests is 30-41 days, where general practice is 22-28 
days. A shorter response time would assist in detecting ML/TF involving Virgin 
Islands companies and facilitate overseas investigations and prosecutions. 
6.53 Once information was provided to foreign CAs, the FSC did not follow up to establish 
whether the information had been useful. Following up with requesting CAs would 
help the FSC determine the usefulness of information it provides and any changes 
needed. 
6.54 Although in 2011-2014, the FSC did not respond to six requests, the FSC has since 
centralized requests processing to reduce the number going unanswered.

Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the FSC 
T 
 
Having inadequate staff to perform inspections and supervisory activities could open 
the Territory to reputational damage by leading both to ML/TF or other financial crimes 
going undetected, and to a failure to monitor regularly the activities of BVI companies 
operating outside the Territory and take appropriate action, including assisting 
counterparts and law enforcement agencies 
 
Inadequate or lax policing of the financial perimeter could lead to ML/TF abuse of the 
BVI financial services regime  
V 
 
Excessive time to respond to requests for information from foreign CAs could mean 
that ML/TF involving a BVI company may go undetected or prosecutions and 
investigations by foreign authorities may be hindered. 
 
Inadequate number of trained human resources dedicated to compliance inspection 
and enforcement of FSC legislation means that the FSC is unable fully to address the 
risk posed by licensees and prevent ML/TF. 
 
Lack of understanding of the risk posed by licensees and particular sectors by the 
FSC prevents appropriate mechanisms being put in place to reduce risk and counter 
ML/TF.

6.55 The ITA executes bilateral and multilateral tax agreements.19 It was established in 
2012 and is a department of Government, directly overseen by the Ministry of 
Finance. The Financial Secretary (FS) delegates to the ITA his functions as CA for 
all exchange of information related to tax matters.  
6.56 The ITA comprises a Director, Deputy Director and six research officers. All staff 
receive ongoing training on their duties as a CA responsible for exchanging tax 
information. Senior staff are involved in key decision-making around MLA and 
international cooperation and advise Government on necessary reforms. All staff 
follow public service rules.  
                                                          
19 These include TIEAs, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters 
(MAAC), the BVI-USA agreement to improve tax compliance and implement the Foreign Account Tax 
Compliance Act (US FATCA), and the UK-BVI agreement to improve international tax compliance (UK 
FATCA). 
 
26 
 
6.57 As a signatory to the IGC MMoU, the ITA can share and receive pertinent 
information with and from Virgin Islands authorities. The ITA has not yet used the 
MMoU. 
6.58 The ITA’s IT system sit within the wider Government network. Segregated access 
ensures confidentiality. The ITA has sufficient servers for automatic exchange of 
information (AEOI)20 and the BVI Financial Account Reporting System (FARS). For 
AEOI, FARS enables FIs to register and upload annual filings which the ITA can 
transmit to the relevant foreign competent authority. 
6.59 Most ITA staff time is spent gathering information in response to EOI requests under 
the TIEAs and the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in 
Tax Matters (MAAC). The volume of requests means the ITA is currently procuring 
a database tailored for its needs, which may add a resource constraint if not fully 
provided for by Government. 
6.60 The ITA is responsible for serving notices to people to provide information. Ending 
a reliance on the Ministry of Finance’s messenger for this would speed up the 
serving of notices and enhance international cooperation. 
6.61 ITA staff receive thorough training around tax evasion, due diligence and EOI 
requests, including on preparing and identifying cases that require an application for 
court warrant or a referral to the ODPP. Senior officers are trained by the OECD as 
Assessors and undertake assessments in other jurisdictions. Offering staff training 
in predicate offences beyond tax-related ones would enhance their appreciation of 
the interrelated nature of predicate offences relating to ML/TF. 
6.62 In the absence of generally available training in EOI, staff are trained through 
competent authorities meetings, peer review group (PRG) meetings, assessor 
training seminars and the Global Forum’s regional seminars. All new employees 
attend these. The Director also trains new staff every week in analysing requests. 
In 2013-2014, the FSC trained the ITA and other IGC members on the FATF’s 
revised 40 Recommendations.  
Automatic exchange of information 
As a member of the Global Forum on Transparency in Tax Matters, the Virgin Islands 
Government is involved in setting the global EOI standard and monitoring its 
implementation. The Virgin Islands is also a member of two Global Forum sub-groups: the 
PRG, which conducts peer reviews of compliance with the standard; and the AEOI Group, 
which is preparing for AEOI and will be the body for the new Common Reporting Standard. 
The international TIEA standard is constantly changing and the Virgin Islands must now

furnish information both upon request and on an automatic basis. At the request of the Virgin 
Islands Government, the UK extended its ratification of the Multilateral Convention on 
Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAAC) to the Virgin Islands on 21 
November 2013 (in force 1 March 2014). The Virgin Islands has also signed the Multilateral 
Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) to enable it to exchange information automatically 
with other MAAC signatories.  
It is too soon to determine the effectiveness of these evolving initiatives. 
6.63 The ITA collaborates with the AGC over general legal matters and MLA-related 
judicial reviews, and with the ODPP over prosecutions. Where licensees do not 
provide the requested information, the ITA reports this for the FSC to consider as 
part of its risk assessments. In 2011-2014, the ITA made 20 submissions to the 
FSC, in some cases seeking information for an EOI request. As noted, the FSC and 
ITA are working to improve the effectiveness of their cooperation. 
6.64 The ITA operates written policies and procedures for handling information requests 
to and from overseas authorities, including a Guide to the International Tax Authority 
of the Virgin Islands. It exchanges information upon request, automatically (e.g. 
under the US-BVI FATCA agreement) and spontaneously. For automatic exchange, 
it does not have to request information, as individuals and entities are required to, 
and do, submit this on an annual basis for the ITA to transmit onwards.  
6.65 While generally cooperative, the local financial services industry has complained 
that ITA notices can be less detailed than those from other CAs and comprise 
“fishing expeditions”. Addressing these concerns would be helpful in maintaining full 
cooperation. 
6.66 Where service providers fail to provide information, the ITA has powers of search 
and seizure (undertaken by the RVIPF) and can refer matters to the ODPP for 
prosecution. However, it has no power to impose administrative penalties itself. 
6.67 The ITA made no referrals in 2011-14 but since 2014 has sent the ODPP five failures 
to respond to a request. The ODPP is still considering three. It decided not to 
prosecute the other two as the companies were struck from the Register, although 
this raises questions as companies can be restored to the Register and they were 
in good standing when the ITA requested prosecution.  
6.68 The ITA receives MLA requests directly or via the MoF and processes these 
according to the MLA(TM)A and TIEAs with requesting jurisdictions. In the absence 
of a TIEA, the ITA cannot legally provide assistance unless this falls within AEOI 
with the jurisdiction. However, where the case relates to criminal matters, including 
tax crimes, the ITA will refer the jurisdiction to the relevant Virgin Islands CA, usually 
the AGC. 
 
28 
 
6.69 The ITA records all outgoing and incoming international cooperation requests. 
Capacity issues are creating a risk of the ITA being perceived as unable to meet its 
international obligations to provide assistance in a timely manner.21 
6.70 It would be helpful for the ITA to seek feedback after providing information to know 
how many cases resulted in prosecution or conviction or are still ongoing. 
6.71 Information requested from TCSPs covers legal and beneficial ownership; directors 
and accounting information; correspondence between the service provider and the 
company; and other general information, such as the purpose for which the 
company was established and company minutes. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the ITA 
T 
 
The length of time to process requests and inability to gather required information 
could leave the ITA unable to provide timely and accurate information to foreign 
counterparts, which would affect investigations into ML/TF or other criminal activities. 
 
The ITA has no power to impose administrative penalties on service providers who 
fail to supply requested information, meaning it has no real deterrent outside of 
commencing court proceedings. This could hinder the ability to comply with requests 
for information and provide full cooperation to enable prosecutions for ML/TF and 
other crimes. 
 
Failure to prosecute or a delay in prosecuting persons who do not comply with  
ITA requests to produce documents and other information has a negative impact on 
the discharge of the ITA’s international obligations, causing difficulties for counterparts 
who require the information to proceed with investigations.

7.1 
The Virgin Islands’ financial services industry is comprised of traditionally regulated 
FIs, which include banking business, insurance business, investment business, 
TCSPs22 and insolvency practitioners. In 2009, regulation extended to the financing 
and money services sub-sector. The largest sub-sector is the TCSPs, which, 
through company incorporations, are also the largest direct revenue generator for 
the Government. The second largest sub-sector is investment business, which by 
its nature exists largely outside of the Territory.  
7.2 
We look below at the sector as a whole and then at individual sub-sectors, based 
on their PAQ responses and interviews (see Methodology box below). 
7.3 
Up to three-quarters of respondents, but not all, had governance structures in place. 
All sub-sectors needed to intensify their efforts to collect beneficial ownership (BO) 
information and verify their clients. Most had sufficient and effective AML/CFT 
internal controls in place, with the possible exception of MSB. 
7.4 
It is a statutory requirement to file SARs/STRs to the FIA  (where there is suspicion 
of ML or TF) and to maintain internal records of filings. The banking and TCSP sub-
sectors make the highest level of filings and over three-quarters of all sub-sectors 
maintain internal records of filings. 
7.5 
ML/TF risks can be created if monetary transactions take place beyond regulatory 
reach, and procedures for electronic funds transfer should be in place.  
                                                          
22 Although the TCSPs are considered as DNFBPs under the FATF Recommendations, in the BVI they 
are treated as part of the financial institutions sector and governed by the rules both for DNFBPs and for 
financial institutions. 
 
 
30 
 
7.6 
The assessment reviewed the extent to which FIs’ business relationships were 
based in jurisdictions which were high risk (i.e. not in Schedule 2 of the AMLTFCOP) 
or known for their political instability or involvement in terrorism. Overall, the FI 
sector presented a medium risk here. 
7.7 
As most do not engage with clients face to face, FIs need to put systems and 
controls in place to mitigate geographical risks. MSBs and banking institutions have 
the greatest opportunity for improvement here. 
7.8 
Looking at risk frameworks and client verification and CDD or extended CDD 
(ECDD) measures, TCSPs and banking institutions’ presented a lower risk than 
insolvency practitioners and insurance.  
7.9 
The FIs play a critical role in the Virgin Islands’ compliance with international 
obligations. Any domestic CA may request BO information directly from any licensed 
entity and failure to respond is an offence.23 In the review period, CAs made 1,414 
requests for information, 95 per cent of these from TCSPs, four per cent from banks 
and one per cent from insurance and investment business. The FSC, with its robust 
enforcement powers, has the greatest success in obtaining information, while the 
FIA issues more typology reports to help FIs address ML/TF deficiencies. 
Methodology for assessing FIs 
Assessors collected data through the PAQs, interviewed FI practitioners and spoke to CAs 
that engage with FIs. They reviewed enforcement action taken, advisory warnings and FSC 
inspections published for 2011-14.  
Of the 277 industry and 277 international cooperation questionnaires sent out, the industry 
survey received 118 responses of which 75 were in a usable format, and the international 
cooperation survey received 89 responses of which 74 were usable (27 per cent of the total 
in both cases). 
Onsite interviews were conducted with management, Compliance Officers and/or MLROs 
in 107 entities: 75 TCSPs, six commercial banks, 15 insurance entities (10 domestic and 
five captive), eight fund administrators, one insolvency practitioner and two money service 
businesses. 
PAQ responses were clarified and additional documentation was reviewed, including 
organisational charts, training logs and AML/CFT compliance manuals and procedures. 
 
 
                                                          
23 Various Acts give the CAs compulsory powers: for the AGC, the Mutual Legal Assistance (USA) Act, 
CJ(IC)A, DTOA and PCCA; for the FIA, the FIAA, PF(P)A, T(UNM)(OT)O) and AT(FOM)(OT)O; for the 
FSC, the FSCA; and for the ITA, the MLA(TM)A.

7.10 Under the FATF Recommendations and as implemented by most regulatory 
frameworks, TCSPs are considered DNFBPs. To ensure due diligence, record 
keeping and internal controls, the Virgin Islands has regulated TCSPs since 1990 
(under the Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990 [BTCA] and the Company 
Management Act, 1990), adding AML/CFT measures in 1998. As noted, only RAs 
may incorporate or register BVIBCs and form limited partnerships. They must 
perform full CDD and ascertain BO information. 
7.11 Many TCSPs are a part of groups operating in other IFCs and most clients are non-
resident in the BVI. TCSPs may manage or administer significant assets for clients 
and encounter high-risk persons, such as PEPs or UHNWIs. They can be asked to 
provide complex structures and they liaise with legal practitioners and accountants 
to ensure compliance with Virgin Islands law. 
7.12 Over the review period, the TCSP sector comprised over 200 licensees. 
7.13 In the review period, some TCSPs were overly reliant on third parties to obtain 
relevant client information. Since 1 January 2016, the AMLR and AMLTFCOP have 
required that where a business relationship is formed through third party 
introduction, all BO information must be immediately obtained from the third party 
and kept in the BVI. As regards client verification and CDD/ECDD, TCSPs could be 
more effective in applying risk assessments and more proactive in filing 
SARs/STRs.  
7.14 It would be helpful to improve the keeping of records and allow for their easy access 
and retrieval. 
7.15 In 2011-14, TCSPs accounted for 30 per cent of all FSC inspections, due to the fact 
that TCSPs act for numerous BVIBCs, which are potentially high risk, and TCSPs’ 
products and services may be susceptible to ML/TF opportunities. Identification of 
contraventions leading to enforcement action appears largely to rely on onsite 
 
32 
 
inspections. This suggests an opportunity for the FSC to go beyond onsite 
inspections to ensure TCSPs follow legal obligations at all times. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for TCSPs 
T 
 
The lack of adequate oversight by Boards of Directors of TCSPs presents material 
risk 
 
Risks are not well managed by TCSPs in their record-keeping practices and 
engagement with third parties, which could lead to criminals going undetected and 
ML/TF complacency 
 
Poor adherence to CDD/ECDD requirements and inadequate STR/SAR reporting. 
 
Poor maintenance of beneficial ownership information means that legal person and 
arrangements could be misused and there would be no ability to identify ownership. 
This could lead to criminals not being detected and prosecuted and proceeds taken 
away. It may also significantly affect the VI’s ability to cooperate internationally, 
whether as a regulator or law enforcement agency.  
V 
 
Operational risks for TCSPs due to poor or inadequate oversight 
 
Poor or inadequate risk assessment framework, which lead to a lack of or improper 
or inadequate identification of risks 
 
Inability to produce full client records in all cases specifically relating to CDD and 
beneficial ownership 
 
Defensive reporting of STR/SAR, which can create difficulties for the FIA in 
identifying ML/TF threats. 
 
Failure of adequate supervision, including absence of appropriate and adequate 
supervisory framework to guide staff.

7.16 Insurance business is licensable under the Insurance Act, 2008 and the IR24 and 
includes domestic insurers, captive insurers, insurance managers, loss adjusters 
and insurance intermediaries (agents and brokers). Domestic insurance accounts 
for most business, and property and casualty insurance in particular pose a low 
                                                          
24 Relevant legislation also includes the BVIBCA and the Regulatory Code 
 
33 
 
AML/CFT risk. Foreign insurance is undertaken primarily by captive insurers, also 
low risk. 
7.17 Insurers must maintain minimum contributed capital and solvency margins. 
Domestic insurers’ Virgin Islands exposures are closely monitored to ensure 
adequate protection in a catastrophe. A foreign insurer must maintain assets in a 
trust in the Territory equal to its liabilities to protect policyholders. This is being 
extended to Virgin Islands insurers in the form of a regulatory deposit with the FSC 
(under the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2015 and Insurance (Amendment) 
Regulations, 2015 (in force as of 1 November 2016).  
7.18 Over the review period, the insurance sector comprised over 200 licensees. 
7.19 Domestic businesses maintain readily available BO information in the Territory. For 
business conducted elsewhere, two-thirds of firms maintain BO information in the 
Territory and where they do not do that, the information is easily accessible. All 
maintain CDD/ECDD information in the BVI, including client verification data. 
Measures for collecting CDD information are adequate in nine out of ten cases and 
client CDD/ECDD is regularly updated. All respondents have written policies for 
accepting customers, of which just under three-quarters were adequate.  
7.20 Staff have sufficient understanding of the purpose of the business relationships 
entered into and no insurance business maintains any banking relationships that 
may be considered high risk. Eighty per cent of respondents claim to carry out 
ML/TF risk assessments of their business relationships, and two-thirds record these 
or have policies in place. 
7.21 The low risk nature of the insurance sub-sector may be why only 27 per cent of the 
respondents filed SARs/STRs with the FIA during the review period. Of these, 87 per 
cent kept a record of the filings.  
7.22 As regards record keeping, four in five do not maintain records of one-off 
transactions but the risk level is medium. The sector is also medium risk in relation 
to the location of its customers, BOs and counter-party transactions. 
7.23 Client-based risk assessment procedures pose a higher risk than for TCSP, banking 
and investment businesses. Sixty per cent of insurers have procedures for 
identifying different customer risk categories and 40 per cent risk profile their 
business relationships. 
7.24 Risk is mitigated by 93 per cent of business having procedures for establishing 
business relationships (although only 60 per cent have procedures for terminating 
these) and 73 per cent have processes for consistent monitoring of customers and 
relationships.  
7.25 Sixty per cent of respondents have mechanisms for ensuring adherence with the 
sanctions list.  None has relationships with FIs in high-risk jurisdictions, although the 
sub-sector relies heavily on non-face to face business, especially for captive 
insurance.  
 
34 
 
7.26 The FSC imposed administrative penalties and issued public (enforcement) 
statements relating to a number of insurance licensees during the review period, 
mostly for corporate governance or operational issues, with nine AML/CFT failures. 
Some insurance business might have been offered by unlicensed entities.  
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for insurance businesses 
T 
 
Inadequate oversight by senior management, which results in breakdowns in the 
operation and application of internal controls.  
 
Poor record keeping, which negates the proper analysis of risk trends. 
 
Inadequate reporting of suspicious activities and suspicious transactions, which could 
mean that criminals are not detected.

7.27  Under the Insolvency Act, 2003, only licensed insolvency practitioners may become 
Virgin Islands administrators, administrative receivers, interim supervisors, 
supervisors, provisional liquidators, liquidators (other than in a solvent liquidation) 
or bankruptcy trustees. An overseas insolvency practitioner may be appointed jointly 
with a Virgin Islands practitioner. As a regulated person, an insolvency practitioner 
is required to maintain AMF/CFT controls. 
7.28 The number of licensed insolvency practitioners is low and in 2014 comprised 25 
accountants and one legal practitioner. Practitioners tend to be part of accountancy 
firms or law firms.  
7.29 The Report’s sample size of five practitioners is too small to draw objective 
conclusions but risks are considered low given the nature of insolvency work 
(relative to liquidations,  receiverships, etc.) and the fact that they are normally 
appointed by the High Court and effectively often take control of an entity as an 
officer of the court. They do not establish anonymous or numbered accounts, nor 
could they do so with local banks.  
7.30 Eighty per cent of respondents have access to BO information in the Virgin Islands 
on their business relationships. Although more than a quarter of insolvency business 
is handled outside of the BVI, the location of some customers, clients and counter-
party transactions poses a low risk. All respondents have CDD/ECDD measures in 
place and adequate written policies for accepting customers, with good 
understanding of client relationships. All carry out risk assessments of their business 
 
35 
 
and business relationships and maintain records. Four out of five maintain records 
of one-off transactions. Records are readily accessible.  
7.31 Forty per cent of respondents have filed SARs/STRs, suggesting a possible need to 
review their mechanisms for consistent reporting of ML/TF threats. 
7.32 In the review period, the FSC made 16 prudential and AML/CFT inspections. It took 
two enforcement actions in 2011 (a licence revocation and a public statement) and 
one in 2013 (a warning letter). Greater inspection would enable more timely 
discovery of any possible ML/TF risks.

7.33 Investment business in the Virgin Islands is regulated by the FSC under SIBA and 
related legislation. This covers recognition and licensing of private, professional, 
public and foreign mutual funds; and incorporation or re-registration of segregated 
portfolio companies as private, professional and public mutual funds.  
7.34 Investment advisers, investment managers, broker/dealers, and fund administrators 
are also licensed. An approval regime is maintained for approved investment 
managers and authorised representatives. Regulations await enactment to permit 
the public issuance of securities in and from within the BVI. 
7.35 In the review period, there were over 500  licensees, over 2000 mutual funds, and 
over 125 segregated portfolio companies. 
7.36 Most service providers are outside the Virgin Islands, but all licensees are subject 
to fit and proper assessments and must have a local authorised representative to 
liaise with the FSC. While it would be helpful to assess providers outside the 
Territory, a review of those in the Territory provides some useful learning. 
7.37 The sub-sector presents a medium risk with some areas requiring closer attention, 
notably BO, CDD, record keeping and client verification. 
 
36 
 
7.38 Nine in ten respondents doing business physically in the Virgin Islands hold BO 
information in the Territory on their business relationships or can make this readily 
available. As many say they maintain regularly updated CDD/ECDD information in 
the Virgin Islands that verified clients’ identity. However, most investment 
businesses are based outside the Territory and more analysis would be useful to 
reduce any risk. 
7.39 Only a quarter of respondents filed SARs/STRs with the FIA in the review period 
and the FIA has records of just four filings. An area for improvement is the 
maintenance of customer records, undertaken by 62.5 per cent: these are important 
if the customer seeks to do other business in or from within the BVI.  
7.40 Three-quarters have documented risk assessment policies and conduct risk 
assessments of their business and business relationships. Nine in ten do frequent 
assessments, although a lower 63 per cent maintain records. Only 13 per cent of 
respondents maintain records of one-off transactions. 
7.41 As regards having AML/CFT control measures or proper AML/CFT training in place, 
the related risk is low. For location of its customers, BOs and counter-party 
transactions, it is medium.  
7.42 Nearly two-thirds have procedures for categorising customer risk, while 88 per cent 
develop business relationship risk profiles, have processes for reporting risk 
concerns to senior management and the Board, operate procedures for establishing 
business relationships and ensure consistent and effective monitoring. Three-
quarters have termination procedures.  
7.43 Eight-eight per cent have mechanisms in place for ensuring adherence with the 
sanctions list, although there is room for improvement in the mechanisms. 
7.44 Investment businesses do not have relationships with FIs in high-risk jurisdictions. 
By their nature, they transact a high level of non-face to face business but this does 
not necessarily represent a risk, particularly if mitigated by proper CDD/ ECDD. 
7.45 In the review period, the FSC carried out 25 onsite inspections. This suggests an 
opportunity to enhance supervisory resources to increase inspections and 
undertake an in-depth analysis of ML/TF and supervisory risks. There were 73 
enforcement actions (warning letters, directives, revocations, cease and desist 
orders, advisory warnings and public statements). None was evidently for AML/CFT 
failures. 
 
 
 
37 
 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for investment businesses 
T 
 
There are some challenges in client verification and implementation of CDD/ECDD 
measures. This presents a material risk from persons who may seek to use mutual 
funds – and ultimately the services of investment managers, investment advisors, fund 
administrators and broker/dealers – for ML/FT. 
 
Challenges in obtaining and maintaining beneficial ownership information reduce the 
ability to identify the risk posed and persons more likely to engage in ML/TF, meaning 
these persons may go undetected and the proceeds of crime may not be taken away. 
 
Deficiencies in how suspicious activities are identified and risk-assessed and how 
STRs/SARs are reported affect the ability to identify criminals engaged in MF/TF and 
increases the FIA’s workload due to the potential for defensive filings only. 
 
The FSC’s ability to regulate and supervise the sector fully from a risk perspective is 
questionable, creating an avenue for criminals to exploit. 
V 
 
Operational risks due to poor or inadequate oversight. 
 
Inadequate conduct of due diligence and maintenance of beneficial ownership 
information.   
 
Inability to produce complete records in a number of cases due to failure to maintain 
proper records.  
 
The role of the FSC as regulator of investment business could be called into question 
in terms of whether and to what extent it is effective. 
 
ML and TF threats not being consistently reported to the FIA or law enforcement, 
primarily through failure to file SARs/STRs.

7.46  The banking sector is regulated under the BTCA and other related regulatory 
legislation and each bank operating in the Territory is licensed. The Virgin Islands 
have a small sub-sector of six commercial banks and one restricted banking 
institution, with a total asset base of $2.4 billion. Approximately 92 per cent is 
domestic banking, and eight per cent international. There are three classes of 
licence under the BTCA. 
7.47 Banks have among the most effective controls of all Virgin Islands sub-sectors. BO 
information is well managed and maintained, with information kept in the Virgin 
Islands or readily available, and staff receive AML/CFT training. There is some 
opportunity for improvement in corporate governance, management of banking 
relationships, verification of domestic business and client demographics.  
 
38 
 
7.48 For example, enhanced management oversight of junior staff for day-to-day 
business transactions would reduce risk. Only half of respondents demonstrated 
that they maintained correspondent banking relationships, had procedures for the 
electronic transfer of funds or documented or circulated risk assessments to staff of 
business and business relationships. While Assessors believe most banks in 
practice do these things, fuller evidence is required. 
7.49 Banks have CDD policies and update their CDD records regularly. Generally, they 
maintain accessible electronic records, including for one-off transactions. Staff know 
the intended purpose of banks’ business relationships, although less so for business 
outside the Territory.  
7.50 Half of the respondents have correspondent banking relationships. The 17 per cent 
of banks who have business relationships with FIs in high-risk jurisdictions carry out 
the necessary ECDD. All requirements of FATF Recommendation 16 on electronic 
transfers are met, although not all banks have written procedures.  
7.51 All banks have filed SARs/STRs with the FIA and recorded this. In the review period, 
banks accounted for 30 per cent of all SARs/STRs filed, demonstrating their 
vigilance. 
7.52 Banks have adequate and appropriate risk assessment policies in place and staff 
understand the banks’ risk appetite and can report risk concerns. Banks observe 
sanctions and have procedures for establishing and terminating business 
relationships. More than four in five have processes in place for consistent 
monitoring of customers. 
7.53 In the review period, the FSC inspected one bank in 2011 for AML/CFT and 
prudential compliance, all seven banks in 2012 and three banks in 2014. Any 
breaches were low level or quickly corrected, not requiring enforcement action.

7.54 Money services businesses (MSBs) have been regulated since the enactment of 
the Financing and Money Services Act, 2009. The first MSB licence was issued in 
2011, followed by another in 2012; that number remained through to 2014. 
7.55 With the global trend towards de-risking, access to the banking system for MSBs in 
the Virgin Islands and the region is extremely limited. Some Virgin Islands banks 
have policies against doing business with MSBs. 
7.56 Some areas of medium risk identified include risk mitigation measures, corporate 
governance (management oversight), maintenance of BO and CDD information, 
and verification of CDD and ECDD information. There is opportunity for 
improvement in how MSBs address risk assessments and report SAR/STRs (see 
7.59 below). 
7.57 Record keeping is good: all respondents maintain records of transactions, noting 
the recipient of funds and the name, address, occupation and telephone of the 
sender.  
7.58 MSBs do not have relationships with other FIs based in high-risk jurisdictions and 
most business is based on face-to-face transactions, all conducted within the BVI. 
Most MSB users do not send large amounts but are largely meeting home country 
obligations such as family support, rent and school fees. Having procedures in place 
for the electronic transfer of funds would still be useful. 
7.59 One of the two MSBs has adequate CDD/ECDD policies for accepting customers. 
It also files SARs/STRs with the FIA and keeps records, frequently risk-assesses its 
business and business relationships, and has appropriate risk assessment policies 
in place. Neither has documented risk assessments that have been circulated to 
staff for AML/CFT guidance. They lack procedures for categorising customers’ risk, 
developing risk profiles of business relationships, establishing or terminating 
 
40 
 
customer relationships, ensuring consistent monitoring of customers and business 
relationships or ensuring adherence with the sanctions list. 
7.60 As at December 2016, the FSC has issued AML/CFT guidelines for the MSB 
subsector.  
7.61 The FSC conducted only one inspection of an MSB during the period under review 
and has not issued AML/CFT guidelines to assist MSBs. Regulation has yet to 
address the aggregate size of remittances, type of clientele and the purpose of 
remittances.

8.1 
The DNFBP sector in the VI is small, considering that the TCSP sector is treated as 
part of the FI sector 25. DNFBPs dealing in precious metals and stone are addressed 
separately in the HVG section of this Report.  
8.2 
There is some uncertainty about numbers as many businesses that engage in 
DNFBP-type activities have trade licences but are not currently required to register 
with the FIA. The FIA estimates there are 57 entitles qualified as DNFBPs under the 
AMLR and AMLTFCOP, comprising 30 legal practitioners (including notaries public), 
15 real estate agents and 12 accountants.  
8.3 
The FIA undertakes AML/CFT supervision and monitoring of DNFBPs. Under the 
AMLR, it oversees and monitors legal practitioners, notaries public and accountants 
for AML/CFT purposes where their services cover real estate, managing client 
assets, managing accounts, paying company contributions, creating, operating or 
managing legal persons, and buying and selling business entities. It also oversees 
and monitors real estate agents (REAs) in buying and selling real estate for a client. 
8.4 
The sector as a whole presents a medium level of risk with regard to governance 
and administration, resources for monitoring AML/CFT risks, internal risk 
assessments, staff training on AML/CFT and SAR/STR reporting. These are 
addressed in more detail below. 
8.5 
There is opportunity to deepen FIA oversight, which consisted mostly of desk 
reviews rather than onsite inspections in the review period. There is also room for 
improvement in the FIA’s cooperation with smaller DNFBPs, who find regulatory 
obligations onerous and can have difficulty submitting compliance manuals for 
approval. 
 
 
                                                          
25 TCSPs qualify as DNFBPs under the FATF Recommendations, which also permit them to be treated as 
FIs, as the NRA does. The Virgin Islands’ 2008 CFATF Mutual Evaluation Report treated TCSPs as FIs 
and applied the relevant FATF Recommendations.

There is no evidence of ML/TF activity among REAs or any attempt at this. All have 
submitted compliance manuals to the FIA, although adherence was unclear. 
8.7 
As regards CDD/EDD, only half of REAs conduct risk-based verification of property 
buyers or file SARs/STRs. This may increase risk based on the nature of activity 
and the fees and value of property involved. 
8.8 
While there is no evidence of any intention to facilitate ML/TF, REAs show a lack of 
familiarity with AML/CFT obligations and what constitutes a suspicious transaction. 
There is opportunity to improve staff training and hence the management of 
adherence to AML/CFT obligations. 
8.9 
REAs regularly accepted cash for property transactions (including rental payments), 
whereas 95 per cent of accountants and law firms did not accept cash at all. Buying 
and selling property was mostly done using wire transfers and cheques. Improved 
awareness is needed of the importance of inquiring into sources of funds and the 
ultimate BO for belongers and non-belongers alike. 
8.10 The FIA did not inspect REAs in the review period.

8.11 Eight in ten legal firms do not normally engage in activities that qualify them to be 
classed as DNFBPs. Those assessed as DNFBPs generally have appropriate 
CDD/ECDD and client verification measures in place. Seven in ten are linked to 
regulated entities such as a Virgin Islands trust company or an international law firm, 
and understand their AML/CFT obligations. Where CDD/ECDD gaps exist, these 
are primarily in relation to record keeping, risk assessments and client services. 
8.12 Most legal firms have at least one practitioner appointed as a notary public and 
nearly all Virgin Islands notaries public are legal practitioners. These present a low 
AML/CFT risk as their reliance on original documents establishes a paper trail and 
requests for their services come from regulated entities, mostly TCSPs.  
8.13 As regards accountants, seven in ten of those reviewed did not engage in activities 
within the scope of the AMLR but mostly undertook auditing and insolvency (the 
latter is addressed in the FI section of this Report). Their audit clients are mainly 
regulated entities, particularly TCSPs. Although they filed only one SAR/STR in the 
review period, accountants pose a low ML/TF risk as they know their obligations and 
have client risk-profiling and monitoring in place.  
8.14 The FIA did not inspect legal firms in the review period, which provokes further 
reflection about its supervision of the DNFBP sector.

Casinos, gambling and lottery 
8.15 There are no licensed casinos in the BVI, gambling is prohibited and lotteries require 
approval from the DGO. There may be some unlicensed sale of foreign lottery tickets 
from the USVI and Puerto Rico. This may potentially create an ML/TF risk as large 
sums attributed to winnings could find their way into the financial system, with 
criminals paying more cash to secure winning tickets to present as a legitimate 
source of funds. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for casinos, gambling and lottery

Use by criminals such as drug traffickers and other organised groups for the purposes 
of “cleaning” ill-gotten proceeds.

that is not regulated under VI law. 
 
Awareness of failings in the enforcement of laws on gambling and the sale of foreign 
lottery tickets could lead money launderers and organised criminal groups to exploit 
this loophole to facilitate criminal activity. 
 
 
                                                          
27 The accounting profession in the VI is currently unregulated, although it is recognised that individual 
accountants would be accountable to their various external accounting bodies with which they are 
registered or enrolled.

9. Non-profit organisations  
9.1 
As of 1 September 2014, there were 131 non-profit organisations (NPOs) operating 
in or from within the BVI: 93 registered under the Non-profit Organisation Act, 2012 
(NPOA), of which 76 were interviewed for the NRA, and 38 unregistered.28 An NPO 
may be incorporated under the BVIBCA or formed by other means. 
9.2 
The NPOs reviewed for the NRA comprised community-based organisations, 
foundations, national country associations, performing arts organisations, religious 
organisations, service organisations, sports organisations and youth organisations. 
9.3 
 In 2009, the FSC took a policy decision not to incorporate any foreign companies 
wishing to carry out non-profit activities outside of the BVI. According to the FSC, 
240 entities have been incorporated as NPOs over the years, of which 40 have 
registered with the Non-profit Registration Board (NPOB). The NPOB is working to 
assist unregistered NPOs to complete the registration process.

9.4 
Unregistered NPOs were not assessed in the NRA. These are viewed as low risk, 
being small and local with very little revenue base.  
9.5 
NPOs may experience difficulties in implementing certain NPOA registration 
requirements, appointing an MLRO and completing their compliance manuals. 
There is opportunity for improvement in how they conduct CDD/risk assessments, 
maintain records and train staff and volunteers. Both the NPOB and the FIA, which 
supervises NPOs, face resource challenges. These are addressed in more detail 
below. 
                                                          
28 The 76 registered NPOs break down as follows: religious organisations 37 per cent, sports 
organisations 16 per cent, service organisations 16 per cent, community organisations 13 per cent, youth 
organisations six per cent, national/country associations eight per cent, foundations three per cent and 
arts organisations one per cent. 
 
46 
 
9.6 
However, NPOs do not pose a material ML/TF risk to the BVI. Many are small, more 
than 80 per cent generate income locally and more than 60 per cent have an annual 
income of $20,000 or less. Those with international affiliations generally rely on the 
systems and procedures of HQs in jurisdictions which are recognised under the 
AMLTFCOP. No NPO appears to engage in high-risk activities or to transact large 
monetary transactions regularly. The bulk of their activities is within the Virgin 
Islands and can be monitored.  
9.7 
Registration requires NPOs to submit a written constitution and 96 per cent have 
done so. Constitutional documents must include the organisation’s name and 
structure, how its governing body is elected, duties and power of the governing body, 
officers, and limitation of objects to solely or primarily charitable or non-profit 
purposes, including a prohibition on distributing dividends to members or 
shareholders. 
9.8 
Following the NRA and since the NPOA came into force in September 2014, the FIA 
has received 106 compliance manuals setting out internal AML/CFT controls, of 
which 82 are being reworked. 
9.9 
Churches have the most significant donor and revenue bases, with five classed as 
major religious institutions by size and congregation base. Some major churches 
did not engage with the NRA and could not be assessed.  
9.10 Two-fifths of NPO respondents (mostly religious and service organisations) have 
appointed an MLRO but not all of these have sufficient knowledge or training. NPOs 
with fewer than five employees may apply for exemption from appointing an MLRO 
but many think they are automatically exempt. 
9.11 Few NPOs carry out background checks on potential members or volunteers. 
Religious organisations expect members to profess a particular faith and do not see 
the need for formal due diligence. This appears to be universal practice amongst 
religious organisations and is generally not viewed as a serious risk.  
9.12 NPOs generally lack understanding of ML/TF. They do not carry out CDD/ECDD or 
risk assessments on donors or recipients, and none filed an SAR/STR in the review 
period. Most do not have measures for dealing with PEPs, although given the Virgin 
Islands’ size it is common for NPOs to engage with PEPs, some of whom sit on 
NPOs’ executive bodies.  
9.13 While this could mean that NPO members might unwittingly participate in ML/TF 
and become susceptible to bribery, the risk is seen as low because funding sources 
within the Virgin Islands are inevitably limited, NPOs have local knowledge about 
donors and PEPs’ donations are mostly $500-$1,000 or less. Two in five NPOs also 
understands the consequences of being targeted for ML/TF and are willing to 
implement AML/CFT policies if guided. 
9.14 NPOs are required to submit annual revenue and expenditure statements. One in 
twenty has an income of over US$250,000 and consistently prepares financial 
 
47 
 
records. This is mainly the larger religious, service and sports organisations, most 
of whose revenue funds operating costs and who may be affiliated with an 
international body. Nine out of ten NPOs provide records of income and expenditure 
but do not prepare full financial statements. 
9.15 Some 37 per cent of the NPOs have international affiliations, of which 57 per cent 
are with religious organisations and the rest with bodies such as Rotary 
International, British Red Cross, FIFA and the International Olympic Committee. The 
high level of trust here means that NPOs do not have written agreements in place 
about the use of their funds or check these have been used as intended.  
Registration and supervision 
9.16 The NPOB is responsible for registering NPOs. Between its establishment in 2013 
and the end of 2014, the NPOB received 203 applications for registration and 
processed 123 that met NPOA requirements. Since end 2014, more NPOs have 
been registered and applications submitted. 
9.17 The NPOB is appointed under the NPOA and comprises seven members, including 
the Registrar, who is an ex-officio member and serves as secretary. It employs no 
other staff. It facilities the development of the non-profit sector in the BVI, promotes 
a local understanding of NPOs’ role, receives and determines NPO applications for 
registration, registers NPOs, receives and reviews NPOs’ financial statements and 
reports, and receives and investigates complaints. 
9.18 Under the AMLTFCOP, the FIA is required to supervise and monitor NPOs for 
AML/CFT compliance via periodic inspections, outreach and analysis of compliance 
manuals. Once it registers an NPO, the NPOB gives the FIA the supervisory 
information it needs through a secure online portal. 
9.19 There is a clear opportunity to improve the NPOB’s effectiveness. While the NPOA 
stipulates 30 working days for processing a registration application, at the time of 
the NRA some applications had been pending for more than nine months, with 38 
known unregistered NPOs operating in the Territory. This is likely due to a lack of 
personnel and the infrequency of NPOB meetings. The NPOB is not contemplating 
enforcement action against NPOs which fail to register.  
9.20 There is limited communication between the NPOB and the FIA, with no formal links 
(the FIA is not represented on the NPOB). The FIA faces a resource challenge in 
supervising and monitoring the NPO sector. It focuses mainly on assessing 
compliance manuals and making recommendations. It has not conducted any onsite 
inspections. The FIA Board may wish to optimise existing resources or provide 
additional ones. 
9.21 Although NPOs said the FIA was slow to provide feedback on their manuals, the 
FIA claimed to have reviewed all manuals and provided relevant feedback. 
Timeframes could not be confirmed. NPOs found an FIA outreach seminar in 2013 
 
48 
 
on compliance with their AML/CFT obligations useful and expressed a desire for 
further guidance.  
9.22 Following the NRA assessment, the Assessors consider that sections 4 and 5 of the 
AMLTFCOP should be reviewed to reduce the compliance burden on smaller NPOs 
as they generally do not signal vulnerability to ML/TF. Supervision by the FIA for 
AML/CFT compliance should still continue on a risk basis. The NPOA should also 
be reviewed to reduce the burdens that have prevented most NPOs from being able 
to register with the NPO Board. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for non-profit organisations 
T 
 
Lack of sufficient education on AML/CFT matters means members of NPOs could be 
influenced unwittingly to participate in or facilitate activities involving theft of funds, 
including ML and TF, and might become susceptible to bribery.  
 
While some NPOs’ activities are highly influenced or controlled by external 
international organisations, such as FIFA, Rotary International and several religious 
bodies, the absence of, or adherence to, proper processes and procedures defining 
their relationships creates potential AML/CFT failures. 
 
PEPs serving in the executive bodies of NPOs may exercise undue influence.  
 
Inadequate internal controls relating to CDD, risk assessments, SAR/STR report and 
source of funding create avenues for criminals to exploit for ML/TF. 
 
NPOs affiliated with “for-profit” entities over which the NPOs exercise full control 
without clear and full operational and financial separation create a serious threat.   
V 
 
Lack of understanding of, and compliance with, the requirements of the NPOA.  
 
Lack of sufficient understanding of ML/TF matters, which leads to reluctance and 
uncertainty about conducting CDD/ECDD and filing SARs/STRs. 
 
No CDD or risk assessment carried out on donors or recipients of funds as NPOs rely 
on informal knowledge of individuals or entities to determine their credibility and 
believe that to request CDD information will be a deterrent to potential donors.  
 
Inadequate resources to review and process applications for registration of NPOs in 
a timely manner. 
 
Inability or unwillingness of the NPO Board to initiate enforcement actions against 
unregistered NPOs. 
 
Inadequate resources to supervise and monitor the NPO sector effectively.

10. High value goods dealers 
10.1 High value goods (HVG) dealers are persons who buy and sell certain high value 
goods for a cash payment of $15,000 or more in any currency. While reviewed 
separately by the NRA, they are supervised by the FIA as a sub-set of DNFBPs. 
The Non-Financial Business (Designation) Notice, 2008 designates four categories 
of HVG dealer: eight boat (yacht) dealers (40 per cent of the sector); six vehicle 
dealers (30 per cent); three jewellers (15 per cent); and three furniture, machinery 
and art dealers (15 per cent). The NRA excluded art dealers as not presenting an 
ML/TF risk.  
10.2 Compliance with AML/CFT obligations varied across the HGV sub-sectors. Areas 
for improvement included training in detecting red flags for ML/TF and the obligation 
to file SARs/STRs. Other areas included ensuring client verification systems, 
conducting CDD/ECDD on business relationships, internal control measures, having 
sufficient resources to monitor staff’s AML/CFT compliance and conducting risk 
assessments. These are addressed in more detail below. 
10.3 Nearly half of the entities reviewed have risk assessed their business. Most high 
value purchases are made through banks, reducing risk. All HVG dealers maintain 
properly kept and easily accessible transaction records. Only some maintain buyer 
identity records, reasoning that most relationships are long standing and they are 
very familiar with their buyers. 
10.4 Just over 40 per cent have internal control mechanisms and proper CDD measures 
in place and 55 per cent were reasonably sensitised to their AML/CFT obligations. 
Just under half have adequate AML/CFT training, and under 60 per cent have the 
required internal controls. Few conduct CDD or file SARs/STRs or can recognise 
potentially suspicious activity.  
10.5 None was inspected for AML/CFT compliance during the period under review, 
although following the NRA, the FIA has inspected seven entities and is raising 
HVGs’ awareness of their obligations. 
10.6 Despite this, the HVG sector is considered to pose only a medium risk. The industry 
is small (only 20 participants), most transactions are carried out using credit/debit 
cards rather than cash, high-value transactions are conducted by FIs (and are 
therefore identified, verified and recorded) and most dealers have adequate record-
keeping measures in place.

compliance in 2015, outside the review period). All maintain AML/CFT compliance 
manuals, seven have internal controls and six have the resources to monitor 
AML/CFT compliance.  
10.8 Brokers generally undertake CDD and ECDD records on every customer 
transaction, risk-assess client relationships and maintain records of this. They also 
maintain easily accessible records of transactions and relationships, and verify and 
maintain buyers’ identities. Most staff appear trained to detect suspicious 
transactions but none has filed SARs/STRs with the FIA. Six are aware of their 
threshold reporting obligation and maintain records.

review period). All maintain AML/CFT compliance manuals, two have internal 
controls and four have the resources to monitor AML/CFT compliance.  
10.10 Only three undertake CDD and ECDD and one risk-assesses client relationships. 
They maintain easily accessible records of transactions and relationships, and verify 
and maintain buyers’ identities. While most staff appear trained to detect suspicious 
transactions, none has filed SARs/STRs with the FIA or seems aware of their 
obligation to do so. Equally, while all are aware of their threshold reporting 
obligation, only four maintain records. All this may heighten ML/TF risk and there is 
a clear opportunity for improvement here.

outside the review period). None maintains AML/CFT compliance manuals, one has 
internal controls and one has the resources to monitor AML/CFT compliance.  
10.12 Only one undertakes CDD and ECDD and one risk-assesses client relationships. 
They maintain easily accessible records of transactions and relationships and one 
verifies and maintains customers’ identities. While staff in one dealer are trained to 
detect suspicious transactions, only a single SAR/STR was filed with the FIA in the 
review period. All are aware of their threshold reporting obligation and two maintain 
records. The represents a medium risk that the dealers may be abused for ML/TF 
purposes and suggests a need for improvement.

manuals, two have internal controls and two have the resources to monitor 
AML/CFT compliance.  
10.14 Two undertake CDD and ECDD and one risk-assesses client relationships. They 
also maintain easily accessible records of transactions and relationships, but only 
one company verifies and maintains customers’ identities. All are aware of their 
threshold reporting obligation and two maintain records. 
10.15 While staff are apparently trained to detect suspicious transactions, no jeweller filed 
a SAR/STR with the FIA in the review period, which presents a heightened risk of 
abuse for ML/TF purposes and would benefit from being addressed.

Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for high value goods dealers 
T 
 
Many visitors to the BVI pay in cash for high value goods like jewellery. This raises 
questions about counterfeiting and sources of funds and could pose an ML risk where 
the appropriate control measures are absent.  
 
Inadequate policies and procedures dealing with risk assessments, AML/CFT training 
and SARs/STRs reporting may enable criminals to conduct ML/TF. 
 
The absence of proper CDD and record keeping measures for purchasing, selling and 
renting yachts could facilitate ML/TF, which poses a threat to the industry.

 
Inadequate internal systems and controls.

Inter-agency cooperation 
11.1 The NRA reviewed seven law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with an AML/CFT 
locus: the Department of Immigration, Her Majesty’s Customs, the Royal Virgin 
Islands Police Force (and its Financial Crimes Unit), the Office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions, the BVI Airports Authority, the BVI Ports Authority, and the 
judiciary (Magistrate’s Court and High Court).  
Methodology for assessing LEAs 
The methodology used to collect and assess data from LEAs differs from that used 
elsewhere in the NRA.  
Except for the RVIPF and the ODPP, PAQs were not used as it was felt that information 
would be better captured through the face-to-face onsite visits. Preliminary information was 
obtained through pre-onsite questionnaires (POQs), and an initial (pre-interview) analysis 
of these was conducted to determine likely threats and vulnerabilities.  
Interviews with each LEA reviewed the accuracy of the information in the POQs, examined 
the perceived threats and vulnerabilities identified and explored whether any others existed.  
11.2 Almost across the board, much room exists for LEAs to improve staff training and 
understanding as regards ML/TF, staffing resources and their overall ML/TF law 
enforcement capability. They will also benefit from having and adhering to policies 
against political and other interference. Each LEA is discussed in turn below.

Control of migrant smuggling activities and handling of deportations 
11.3 The Immigration Department (ID) is responsible for controlling entry into the Virgin 
Islands and approving residence of people within the BVI. 
11.4 The ID is headed by the Chief Immigration Officer (CIO), who reports directly to the 
Permanent Secretary in the Premier’s Office. The ID is governed by the Immigration 
and Passport Ordinance and the CIO and other staff are bound by public service 
rules. A Board of Immigration functions in an advisory and consultative capacity, 
without executive or administrative power. 
11.5 The ID overall appears to pose a low risk, although a lack of data left questions 
open. As set out below, areas of improvement include training in AML/CFT matters; 
investigation into migrant smuggling and human trafficking to determine links with 
organised crime and ML/TF; and cooperation between the ID, HMC, RVIPF and 
ODPP. These are addressed in more detail below. 
11.6 Staff numbers rose from 49 in 2011 to 52 in 2014 but the department hopes for 
more. Resource challenges can see trained immigration officers reassigned to 
clerical and administrative tasks, working long extra shifts at entry ports and being 
tired on the job. 
11.7 A major part of the ID’s job is to screen persons entering the BVI, which includes 
preventing the smuggling of migrants29. Staff are trained to spot forged passports 
but less so in investigative techniques or AML/CFT matters. In the review period, of 
76 smuggled migrants detected, none was prosecuted and all were repatriated. 
11.8 Strong governance within the ID will reduce the Virgin Islands’ vulnerability to 
migrant smuggling and human trafficking, as well as to the bribery and corruption of 
ID officers. New officers are given the public service rules and cautioned to resist 
bribes and corruption but there is no specific training in this or guidance against 
outside interference from politicians, suspects, the accused, other LEAs, etc. Two 
cases are pending of bribery and corruption involving immigration officers. 
11.9 It would be helpful to put systems in place to record the detection, prevention and 
treatment of migrant smuggling. The ID was unsure of how many migrant smuggling 
cases HMC referred to it in the review period, of links to organised crime or ML/TF, 
                                                          
29 The top five countries from which migrant smuggling cases originate are Haiti, the Dominican Republic, 
Cuba, Brazil and Columbia. 
 
55 
 
or of migrants’ countries of origin. There were two convictions for human trafficking 
in 2011 but no known cases in 2012 and 2013.  
11.10 The Territory’s porous borders require extra vigilance as they lend themselves to 
weapons and people smuggling. This requires the Entrex electronic border 
management system to be used more consistently than now, and for officers at ports 
of entry to learn the names of people subject to UN sanctions. 
11.11 As regards intra-agency cooperation, informal procedures may exist for receiving 
referrals from, and exchanging information with, the RVIPF, HMC, FIA, ODPP, 
BVIPA and BVIAA but the presentation of case files to the ODPP was the only 
evident one. 
11.12 For the review period, it would have been helpful to see records of the following: 
 
No. of cooperation and exchange of information matters made by or to the ID 
 
Number that resulted in further investigation, prosecution or conviction 
 
Any overseas cooperation arrangements to combat migrant smugglers and 
people traffickers 
 
Number of international cooperation requests the ID made or received, and to 
and from whom 
 
How long it took the ID or foreign authorities to respond 
 
Number that resulted in further investigation, prosecution or conviction 
 
Members of staff responsible for international cooperation matters 
 
Outstanding international cooperation requests made or received 
 
Internal international cooperation procedures or guidelines 
 
Number of people deported in 2011-2014 linked to organised crime or TF 
 
Number of people denied entry into the BVI, including the reason. 
11.13 The ID maintains manual records and data on deportation, migrant smuggling and 
human trafficking but the tracking and combatting of migrant smuggling and human 
trafficking would benefit from improving storage, the recording of EOI and 
international cooperation and the analysis and assessment of information collected.  
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the Immigration Department 
T 
 
Issue related to management and governance include corruption among staff could 
lead to criminal activity going undetected. 
 
Criminals such as migrant smugglers, human traffickers and money launderers and 
other criminals dealing with importation of goods may go undetected due to poor 
records management, insufficient training, human resource constraints and failings in 
other policies and procedures, including domestic cooperation.

 
Insufficient number of immigration officers at the designated ports of entry and long 
working hours may leave the VI vulnerable to inadequate checks and balances at the 
front line and risk the entry of undesirable persons.

Lack of training of immigration officers (including in AML/CFT, FATF Methodology, the 
FATF 40 Recommendations, the UN Convention against Transnational Organised 
Crime, the UN Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, 
FATF ML/TF predicate offences, and resisting bribery and corruption) limits 
immigration officers’ ability to detect, prevent and deal with persons who may violate 
the VI’s immigration laws and by extension other laws. 
 
Lack of proper or easily retrievable records affects the ID’s ability to track and combat 
migrant smuggling and human trafficking.

Handling of seized assets, smuggling and security breaches  
11.14 Her Majesty’s Customs (HMC) prevents restricted and prohibited goods from 
entering or leaving the territory and assists with border protection in cooperation with 
the ID and the RVIPF.  
11.15 It comes under the Ministry of Finance and the Commissioner of Customs reports 
directly to the Financial Secretary. HMC is governed by the Customs Management 
and Duties Act, 2010 and its staff are bound by the public service rules. 
11.16 HMC poses a low risk overall. Staff training (including around bribery and 
corruption), the handling of seizures and smuggling, and vulnerability to security 
breaches would benefit from greater focus. These are addressed in more detail 
below. HMC hopes for more space, staff and resources but the need for this requires 
independent review. 
11.17 Governance systems ensure that the Commissioner is updated and informed about 
relevant matters to exercise proper oversight. He and his senior staff are involved 
in key decisions on enforcement matters. Depending on the infractions, they also 
involve the RVIPF. The Commissioner works in tandem with other agencies such 
as the ID, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Fisheries and VISR. 
11.18 Staff numbers increased from 83 to 99 (15 per cent) between 2011 and 2014, mainly 
in customs officers. HMC has access to the Regional Clearance System (RCS) and 
its regional network includes the US Coast Guard in St Thomas and Puerto Rico 
and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  
11.19 HMC has five special units.  
 
The Marine Task Force undertakes enforcement at borders and ports, 
including marine interdictions 
 
57 
 
 
The Flex Team examines goods entering and leaving the Virgin Islands 
outside of designated customs areas and supports joint operations with local 
and international LEAs 
 
The K-9 Unit provides canine support, mainly for the search and rummage of 
larger cargo vessels 
 
The Internal Audit Team ensures value for money and compliance with all 
relevant laws and regulations 
 
The Customs Automated Processing System (CAPS) Team guides, 
streamlines and automates the electronic clearing of goods.  
11.20 Enforcement staff receive training in investigative techniques, including risk profiling 
of individuals. An area for improvement is ML/TF and detecting cross-border cash 
movements. A number are aware of the FATF 40 Recommendations and 
Methodology but less so of the UN Conventions against Transnational Organised 
Crime and on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances as they relate to smuggling. 
Some new recruits receive integrity training and all staff are expected to follow public 
service rules. Only the Commissioner has had specific anti-bribery and corruption 
training. 
11.21 As regards conflicts of interest, all civil servants are required to disclose their 
business interests and seek the DGO’s permission to conduct such business. Since 
2012, CAPS has curtailed activities such as customs broker duties without 
permission, as brokers have to be issued an account to use the system. 
11.22 To prevent bribery and corruption, teams of customs officers are rotated, and 
information about containers arriving at the ports is recorded on the Overseas 
Territories Regional Investigative System, which HMC, the ID and the RVIPF share. 
HMC would benefit from having specific measures against outside interference and 
internally audit how officers deal with people and goods entering or exiting the BVI.  
11.23 The Commissioner cannot directly suspend a corrupt officer but must lodge a report 
which may lead to disciplinary action. In the review period, the absence of a 
recording system means it is not clear whether any reports were made, although 
one officer was arrested for corruption and subsequently released and another was 
sentenced to two years in prison.  
11.24 Looking at port clearance and border patrol, cargo vessels who want to use non-
designated ports of entry must first notify the BVI Ports Authority (BVIPA) and seek 
HMC approval. HMC also relies on international cooperation and a designated 
hotline for intelligence on vessels entering the territory. All officers are trained in risk 
profiling of travellers, which may lead them to allow clearance, do more in-depth 
inspection or involve the RVIPF.  
11.25 To prevent illegal entry, HMC patrols non-designated ports of entry based on 
intelligence received. Special operations teams may carry firearms. Operations 
 
58 
 
involving US LEAs use the US-BVI Shiprider Agreement. Combined with the 
presence of a US Coast Guard cutter, this enhances HMC’s capabilities and acts as 
a significant deterrent.  
11.26 People entering and exiting the Virgin Islands must declare whether they are 
carrying money to the value of US$10,000 or more. An incoming declaration form is 
mandatory and outgoing passengers are expected to self-disclose: this could be 
made clearer. In line with FATF Recommendation 32, penalties for failing to declare 
range from forfeiture to fines and imprisonment.  
11.27 In 2011-14, no outgoing monetary seizures were recorded. Incoming travellers 
made 3,120,268 declarations of being within the threshold. Five were found to be 
false and a total of US$485,839 was seized. Training in identifying suspicious 
persons and detection of cash smugglers are two areas for improvement. Greater 
clarity is needed about whether cash declarations are given to the FIA to analyse, 
in line with FATF Recommendation 32, and whether HMC reviews declarations data 
for AML/CFT trends and typologies.  
11.28 Once monies are detected, the RVIPF’s Financial Crime Unit is called in to 
investigate. In 2011-14, cash seizures led to 11 arrests (multiple arrests may follow 
a single cash seizure), six resulting in prosecutions and one in conviction and cash 
forfeiture. People may sign an “Admission of Guilt” form to avoid prosecution. Clarity 
is needed about the use of this and whether it routinely means lower penalties than 
if breaches went to court. 
11.29 HMC also undertakes other types of seizure. During the review period, eight drug 
seizures led to 14 arrests and three prosecutions; and seven seizures of other 
illegal/restricted items led to two arrests and no prosecutions. In 2014, one marine 
vessel was seized for cash violation. There were no seizures or arrests relating to 
banned substances or counterfeit items and no seizures of vessels for human 
trafficking or people smuggling.  
11.30 Data may not reflect the depth or risk of smuggling and other crimes because the 
Virgin Islands imports most goods, HMC resources are limited at various ports and 
there are some border control issues. ODDP and RVIPF data do not shed light on 
whether HMC seizures follow proper procedures, leading to formal investigation and 
prosecution. The RVIPF does not appear to keep HMC informed of the outcome of 
investigations following a seizure. There is opportunity to improve statistical 
management and sharing of records among HMC, the ODPP and the RVIPF. 
11.31 As regards inter-agency cooperation, alongside the general IGC MoU, HMC has 
separate MoUs with the RVIPF and ID. The robustness of the cooperation that HMC 
renders or receives is not clear, nor is it clear that the MoU with the ID is used. Once 
assets are seized, HMC is responsible. It would normally be expected to lead joint 
operations with the RVIPF and ID but this does not appear to be documented and 
 
59 
 
is not always smooth, with the lead agency dependent on type of operation and 
seniority of officers.  
11.32 In 2011-13, only six referrals resulted in further investigation, all being to HMC from 
the RVIPF. No matters referred to or from HMC resulted in prosecution and further 
RVIPF or FIA investigations are not apparent. 
11.33 HMC pursues international cooperation as a member of the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Area Agency and the Caribbean Customs Law Enforcement Council. It 
participates in the World Customs Organisation through the Virgin Islands’ 
relationship with the UK, which is a member. During the review period, HMC did not 
make or receive any cooperation requests to or from these organisations.  
11.34 HMC responds directly to international information requests. It does not set a 
timeframe but claims to do so efficiently, and there were no outstanding requests at 
the time of the NRA. Two to three staff were responsible for international cooperation 
in 2012 but none were in 2011 or 2013. It would be helpful to develop records to 
verify numbers of requests and the adequacy of staffing. 
11.35 Easily retrievable and updated records are kept as regards interception of smuggling 
and evasion of customs duty, but this is not the case for domestic and international 
cooperation. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for Her Majesty’s Customs 
T 
 
Issues related to management and governance include staff corruption could lead 
to criminal activity going undetected. 
 
Criminals such as migrant smugglers, human traffickers and money launderers 
and other criminals dealing with importation of goods may go undetected due to 
poor records management, insufficient training, human resource constraints and 
failings in other policies and procedures, including domestic cooperation. 
 
Non-declaration and lack of ability to detect this, primarily in relation to cash, may 
result in the proceeds of crime not being take away. 
V 
 
Although a porous Territory, the VI lacks the capacity to patrol all its borders 
effectively, making it vulnerable to transnational criminal activity, including ML, 
movement of firearms, human trafficking, the smuggling of people and goods, 
commercial fraud and other cross-border criminal activity. However, US-VI 
cooperation arrangements help immensely in protecting the borders. 
 
The absence of measures to detect false self-reporting or non-reporting when 
leaving the Territory creates a vulnerability at ports of entry.

11.36 The Royal Virgin Islands Police Force (RVIPF) is governed by the Police Act. 
Various statutes confer powers for specific matters.30 Its duties include maintaining 
law and order, preserving peace, defending the Virgin Islands from external 
aggression or threat (including border protection), protecting life and property, 
preventing and detecting crime, and enforcing the Virgin Islands’ laws. It arrests and 
detains suspects, prefers or initiates charges and forwards matters for prosecution 
to the ODPP. 
11.37 Of all the LEAS, the RVIPF has the greatest number of high-risk areas for 
improvement. These include staff training in AML/CFT matters, handling of outgoing 
MLA requests and of incoming MLA and extradition requests from foreign CAs, 
records maintenance and accessibility, feedback on declined requests and 
monitoring BVIBCs for ML/TF activities. Other areas are governance and 
administration, inter-agency cooperation on incoming MLA requests and handling of 
investigations relating to ML/TF. These are addressed in the following paragraphs 
(11.38-11.62) 
11.38 Governance is led by the RVIPF’s management team, which comprises the 
Commissioner of Police (COP), his Deputy (DCOP), three Superintendents and six 
Chief Inspectors.  
11.39 The Crime Division has major responsibility for investigating crimes. It is overseen 
by a Detective Superintendent and consists of a Crime Unit and a Special 
Investigations Unit, each of which is overseen by a Detective Chief Inspector.  
11.40 Within the Crime Division, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) 
investigates theft, fraud, robbery and similar crimes; the Scenes of Crime Unit deals 
                                                          
30 For instance, the RVIPF’s powers in relation to ML investigations are derived from the D(PM)A (Cap. 
178), DTOA, CJ(IC)A and PCCA. 
 
61 
 
with forensics and evaluates and processes all crime scenes; and the Family and 
Juvenile Unit deals with domestic violence, child protection and sex offenders. 
11.41 Within the Special Investigations Unit, the Major Crimes Unit deals with murder, 
firearms, sex offences, serious and organised crime and drug trafficking; the 
Financial Crime Unit (FCU) investigates fraud, corruption, drug trafficking, 
proceeds of crime and cash seizures (as set out in a policy document); the 
Intelligence Unit and Technical Collection Unit deal with intelligence gathering; and 
the Proactive Unit deals with special investigations and covert operations. 
11.42 The FCU and CID are on the Territory’s front line in the fight against ML/TF and 
have protocols for they should execute their duties. 
11.43 Disciplinary matters are governed by the Police Act and Police Regulations and an 
internal policy, although it is not clear how far the latter is followed. An Organisational 
Risk Group consisting of the COP, Deputy COP and other senior officers addresses 
corruption and misbehaviour and meets once a quarter. Several officers were under 
investigation for corruption during the NRA.  
11.44 The Governor has constitutional responsibility for security matters and a National 
Security Council (NSC) advises him on internal security. The NSC has to approve 
any recommendation to appoint an officer above Chief Inspector rank. The Governor 
may delegate his powers but does not appear to have done so during the review 
period. The NSC comprises the Governor (as Chairman), Premier, Deputy Premier 
(as the Premier’s nominee), Attorney General and COP.  
11.45 The Police Service Commission (PSC) advises the Governor on appointing, 
removing and disciplining RVIPF officers. It has five members appointed by the 
Governor, two directly, one on the Premier’s advice, one on the Leader of the 
Opposition’s advice and one after consultation with the Police Welfare Association.  
11.46 In 2014, the total number of police staff rose to 233 (45 constables, 41 sergeants, 
24 inspectors and 23 auxiliary staff) from 209 in 2011. At end 2014, 26 posts were 
vacant, compared with 12 in 2011. Thirteen officers had been interdicted, mostly for 
criminal matters. Greater focus on officer conduct would be beneficial.  
11.47 Budget cuts meant that in the review period, three of the Virgin Islands’ seven police 
stations required refurbishment, with one of these closed. The force did not recruit 
in 2012 and 2013, some cars are over ten years old and training expenditure is low. 
Following the NRA, improvements were undertaken in relation to the affected 
stations and the closed station was reopened. 
11.48 Staffing is a high-priority area for improvement. Crime Division staffing needs to be 
commensurate with the level of criminal activity, as do FCU and CID resources 
(including space for staff and files) and expertise, given these units’ importance in 
investigating financial crime, including ML/TF and predicate offences. Border 
protection appears to be undertaken largely by the Marine Unit and there is an 
opportunity to improve cooperation and coordination between this Unit and HMC 
 
62 
 
and the ID. Having policies, procedures and clear leadership in place for joint 
operations would enhance the ML/TF fight.  
11.49 In the review period, FCU officers received limited training, mainly at three-year 
intervals, in investigative techniques and AML/CFT matters. This covered some 
ML/TF predicate offences but not PF. New recruits and lower ranks receive basic, 
in-house AML training and this should be refreshed. The RVIPF training budget as 
a whole was reduced to $40,000 in 2014 from $90,200 in 2011. Following the NRA, 
a paper on enhancing the RVIPF’s training was submitted to the NSC.  
11.50 The Virgin Islands has criminalised all predicate offences under the FATF 
Methodology. This includes major crimes against the person or property, sex-related 
crimes (including trafficking of sex workers and the sexual exploitation of children), 
customs and immigration violations (including human trafficking and migrant 
smuggling), firearms and weapons offences, fraud (including counterfeiting), 
narcotics offences, tax crimes and other predicate offences. Other predicate 
offences cover terrorism (including terrorist financing), piracy, insider trading, 
environmental crime, extortion, corruption and bribery, racketeering, illicit trafficking, 
counterfeiting and product piracy, kidnapping, illegal restraint and smuggling. 
11.51 Over the review period, no cases were recorded for these other predicate offences. 
They appear to pose a lesser threat to the Territory, assuming LEAs are able to 
detect, investigate and prosecute them. There was a reduction in most major crime 
areas, although narcotics and assault offences markedly increased (the Virgin 
Islands is considered a drugs transhipment point between South and North 
America). Detection rates were up for major crimes, fraud and narcotics offences, 
but down for firearms/weapons offences and sex-related offences. 
11.52 The process for investigations is that a Superintendent decides whether to prefer a 
charge (he may seek ODPP advice) and the DPP decides whether to prosecute. A 
written manual sets out what should be on file so the ODPP can advise on whether 
a case should be discontinued. The RVIPF also has a charge vetting form which 
identifies relevant issues and is reviewed by senior officers before submission to the 
ODPP. Case summary forms serve a similar purpose and are used throughout the 
RVIPF.  
11.53 There is some delay between when the RVIPF makes an initial report and then 
submits a file to the ODPP, despite internal policy that investigations into summary 
offences must be submitted to the ODPP within three to four months (they cannot 
be proceeded with after six months). Indictable matters that are not statute barred 
may take longer to investigate and prosecute. ML offences and most predicate 
offences are indictable and not statute-barred.  
11.54 The RVIPF sent a high proportion of recorded cases to the ODPP for consideration, 
ranging from 21.3 per cent in 2012 to 24.3 per cent in 2014. Guidance for officers 
on completing investigations and an expansion of expertise and resources would 
reduce delays between offences being recorded and submitted. Addressing 
 
63 
 
disparities between the categories of offences which the RVIPF and ODPP record 
would facilitate the matching of charges brought to offences prosecuted and the 
reconciliation of data. 
11.55 The FCU has a mandate to assist with foreign law enforcement inquiries and 
investigations. It investigates overseas requests and forwards them to the relevant 
Virgin Islands agency. Where a requested matter is outside its jurisdiction, the FCU 
directs the requesting agency to the most appropriate Virgin Islands agency. 
11.56 The FCU carried out, on average, 31 ML investigations for each of the years under 
review. These investigations typically were a result of intelligence reports received 
from the FIA in relation to SARs/STRs that would have been filed by reporting 
institutions. Additionally, some were a result of requests for assistance from other 
foreign LEAs and criminal investigations into predicate offences committed within 
the BVI.  
11.57 The CID does not generally consult the FCU about the ML aspects of the predicate 
offences it investigates. The FCU has suggested to the CID developing a common 
procedure, which would enable proper investigations, but this has not been taken 
up and there is no evidence of such a procedure. Giving greater priority to the FCU’s 
role within the RVIPF would enhance the ML investigation of predicate offences. 
There is an opportunity for the CID to consult the FCU as a matter of course and 
develop a common procedure. 
11.58 It would be helpful to analyse crime data to explore the RVIPF’s contention that 
many ML offences are not committed in the Virgin Islands and that existing 
legislation should be extended beyond criminal forfeiture to civil confiscation. The 
RVIPF would like local FIs and other entities to respond to its requests for 
information without court orders and search warrants. 
11.59 The RVIPF’s MoU with the FIA for processing Interpol requests could operate more 
effectively. The FIA suggested that if the RVIPF forwarded requests to it more swiftly 
and not in batches, responses to Interpol might be speeded up by 30 to 60 days 
(this could not be verified in the absence of request handling procedures). It would 
be useful for the RVIPF to collect data on the number of requests received and 
forwarded, response times to Interpol and whether any requests were declined. The 
FIA recorded an unexplained 66 per cent decrease in Interpol requests received 
from the RVIPF in 2013. 
11.60 As the agency responsible for investigating all crimes in the Territory, the RVIPF is 
required to liaise with all CAs, other LEAs and other agencies. HMC was not clear 
about the outcome of matters it had sent to the RVIPF for investigation, and 
introducing a policy of maintaining information about referrals from CAs and LEAs 
should be a priority improvement. Addressing the gap in record-keeping and 
maintenance would allay concerns about leadership, resources and appropriate 
policies and procedures.  
 
64 
 
11.61 The RVIPF’s case and file management records are primarily paper-based. Using 
technology and other mechanisms to share information internally, whether generally 
or confidentially, would be helpful. Improving the RVIPF’s ability to provide accurate 
and current statistical data (eg on number and types of crime, investigations, 
convictions and international information requests) would enable measurement of 
the force’s effectiveness and the allocation of resources to areas of greatest risk, 
including ML/TF.  
11.62 The RVIPF has not made significant confiscation of the proceeds of crime (see 
Section 12 for details). 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the Her Majesty’s Customs 
T 
 
Failures such as corruption means there is potential for persons engaged in ML/TF to 
go undetected  
 
Lack of proper human resources and training, poor records management and slow 
handling of MLA requests contribute to the possibility of crimes not being detected or 
prosecuted and of criminals such as migrant smugglers, human traffickers, drug 
traffickers, money launderers and those involved in child exploitation going 
undetected. 
 
Failure to conduct timely ML/TF investigations means persons engaged in ML/TF may 
not be detected and proceeds of crime may not be taken away. 
V 
 
Challenges in curtailing corrupt practices within the RVIPF. 
 
Lack of training in AML/CFT, predicate offences for ML and ML/TF investigative 
techniques. 
 
Lack of proper and adequate human and technical resources. 
 
Lack of sufficient internal coordination and cooperation on general policing matters, 
including investigations.

ML prosecutions 
11.63 The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) is an independent team of 
prosecutors headed by the DPP, who is responsible for all its proceedings. The DPP 
initiates prosecution and can discontinue this where proceedings have commenced. 
 
65 
 
The DPP is also responsible for the ODPP’s operational procedures, including the 
recent overhaul of its case management system. Staff are bound by public service 
rules and the ethical rules and standards of the legal profession. 
11.64 The current structure works well, despite a wide gap between the DPP and the next 
most senior officer, the Principal Crown Counsel. The DPP is not answerable to any 
other person or authority (his or her independence is guaranteed under the Virgin 
Islands Constitution 2007) and there is no indication of outside interference or 
conflicts of interest. 
11.65 Although there is limited data on the prosecution of ML/TF cases, recent training 
suggests that the ODPP has a good understanding of AML/CFT matters. Expanded 
resource constraints would enhance the ODPP’s effectiveness, including 
coordination and cooperation between the ODPP and the RVIPF and with other 
LEAs. 
11.66 ODPP staff numbers were fairly consistent during the review period, from 15 in 2011 
to 14 in 2014. Claim of an increased caseload could not be confirmed as the ODPP 
does not measure caseload per worker. Prosecutorial staff has not increased since 
2007, despite repeated requests, which may over time affect morale and 
effectiveness.  
11.67 Consolidating amendments to the Criminal Code of 1997 would strengthen the rule 
of law by ensuring the correct statutes were being referenced. Improvements to the 
record management system would support risk assessment and trend analysis. A 
comparison of High Court, Magistrate’s Court, RVIPF and ODPP case numbers in 
the review period reveals more convictions than prosecutions and no details on 
types of case, including ML, and outcomes. In 2014, the ODPP started to move from 
a manual case management system to a fully automated one. 
11.68 Great effort was made to enhance the ODPP’s ability to deal with ML matters in 
2013/2014. A Criminal Justice Advisor from the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service 
(CPS) undertook reviews of systems and operations and of legislation relating to ML 
and asset recovery. This led to new training and a two-day symposium with the 
RVIPF, AGC, ODPP, ITA, FSC and FIA.  
11.69 The ODPP’s complaints procedure appears sufficient to deal with any possible 
issues of corruption or conflicts of interest. Although staff have not had specific 
training in this, the ODPP indicated that it is governed by the UK Crown Prosecution 
Service’s Code for Crown Prosecutors and ODPP staff seem well-attuned to the 
potential for bribery and corruption. The ODPP is respected and there is no evidence 
of any corrupt conduct over the review period. If anyone has a conflict with a matter, 
they may vet a file but not prosecute it. 
11.70 The ODPP prosecuted 1,110 predicate offences over the review period. Conviction 
rates in the High Court (HC) are 20 per cent higher than in the Magistrates’ Court 
(MC) but it is not clear why. There were no ML or TF prosecutions. This seems to 
 
66 
 
be because the RVIPF prioritises predicate offences and forfeitures instead of 
investigating the ML dimension at the same time. 
11.71 When reviewing RVIPF files, prosecution staff must identify on a form any ML 
element and whether the RVIPF has investigated this (which it usually has not 
done). In 2012, the ODPP sent back 100 referrals for various reasons. Most were 
said to come from the RVIPF but as data is not consistently presented in the same 
format, it is unclear how many directed investigation into an ML aspect.  
11.72 There could be greater willingness to pursue and prosecute ML-related offences. In 
the review period, the ODPP sent only 61 of 1,296 cases referred to it (less than five 
per cent) back to the RVIPF for further investigation. This suggests most could have 
been prosecuted. It is not clear that the ODPP provides guidance to the RVIPF on 
how to investigate ML or that ML is discussed during investigations.  
11.73 The ODPP is responsible for confiscation and forfeiture. The impetus to pursue 
confiscation as part of the prosecution process appears limited, with no evidence of 
confiscation. Indeed, LEAs generally appear satisfied with forfeiture. Fuller training 
on asset recovery, asset restraint, confiscation and forfeiture might improve this. 
Following the NRA, the ODDP accepts that pursuing asset confiscation should form 
part of the prosecution process and is providing guidance to its staff, the RVIPF and 
other relevant LEAs. (See more details in Section 12 of this Report.) 
11.74 Extradition is generally undertaken by the AGC and the ODPP is only involved when 
requested to make a determination or provide an opinion on the evidence. The AGC 
and the GO have guidance in place for the ODPP’s role in extradition. 
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the ODPP

 
Inability to pursue prosecution for ML offences and pursue confiscation affects the 
ability to take away proceeds of crime.

11.75 BVI Airports Authority (BVIAA), which is both a statutory body and registered 
company, is responsible for the Virgin Islands’ three airports, Terrance B Lettsome 
International Airport on Beef Island, Taddy Bay Airport on Virgin Gorda and Auguste 
George Airport on Anegada. 
11.76 Main areas for improvement are around security, training, cooperation with the 
relevant LEAs, airports, risk assessment, risk rating and procedures and guidelines. 
These are set out in more detail below. A camera system monitors the airports and 
restricted areas throughout the day. It would be helpful to introduce a system for risk 
rating the activities that take place. 
11.77 A Board of Directors meets monthly to determine policy and provide direction. Day-
to-day management sits with the Managing Director and senior staff. They are 
involved in key enforcement decisions, mostly where enforcement is challenged.  
11.78 All staff are made aware of the governance structure and know their remit. The 
number of staff grew by 14 per cent in the review period, from 160 in 2011 to 182 in 
2014 and appears sufficient.  
11.79 Looking at training, the Chief Security Officer is experienced, knowledgeable about 
AML/CFT matters. He has been trained on the FATF 40 Recommendations and to 
some extent on investigative techniques. General security and enforcement staff 
have an understanding of the Convention on International Civil Aviation but limited 
familiarity with the FATF Recommendations and Methodology as regards red flags 
for ML/TF and SARs. Opportunities for improvement include written procedures and 
training in investigative techniques and ongoing trends in criminal activity. 
11.80 As a registered company, the BVIAA functions independently and there is no 
evidence of interference. In 2013, it began developing formal corporate governance 
that would mitigate against political interference 
11.81 Although the BVAA lacks formal policies and procedures against bribery and 
corruption, the Employee Handbook outlines what employees should do if 
confronted with this. There is ongoing, preventative screening of staff and no 
evidence that staff have been involved in bribery or corruption has come to light. 
11.82 Acting on a Board recommendation, the Minister responsible for communication 
may give qualified officers police powers of arrest and seizure at airports. There do 
not appear to be guidelines for this and only the Chief Security Officer has this 
 
68 
 
power. Arrest and seizure might be made more efficient if security officers on the 
ground did not have to rely on HMC and the RVIPF, who are not always present. 
11.83 The Chief Security Officer is stationed at the Terrance B Lettsome International 
Airport (TBL). Police officers are not present on a regular basis at Taddy Bay Airport 
(which is a designated international airport) or Auguste George Airport. While in 
theory this may leave them more vulnerable to security breaches, all breaches in 
the review period were at TBL.  
11.84 In 2011-13, seven security breaches were recorded, six reported to the RVIPF 
and/or HMC and three arrests made. There were 4,543 prohibited or restricted 
goods intercepted, seized and disposed of. One case of undeclared cash was 
detected in 2011 to a value of $45,000, with two arrests. Unwritten procedures are 
in place for detecting the smuggling of contraband (mainly cash, jewellery and 
firearms), although not whether a breach is related to terrorism, and cases are 
handed over to the RVIF. All security officers know the procedures.  
11.85 There is some inter-agency cooperation, in particular with HMC and the RVIPF and 
ID. Joint Police, Immigration, Customs and Airport Management meetings take 
place bi-annually and include representatives from airlines operating in the BVI. 
BVIAA staff also meet the NSC twice a year to discuss security.  
11.86 The BVIAA is a signatory to the IGC MoU but does not appear to have used it. It 
has no formal cooperation agreement with the RVIPF, HMC or ID and uses verbal 
agreements to deal with issues not covered under the IGC MoU, such as information 
exchange and referrals. More personnel from other agencies at the airports would 
be helpful in alleviating problems.  
11.87 The BVIAA makes relatively few referrals and the four it made in the review period 
(for weapons and jewellery) do not appear to have led to further investigation or 
prosecution. The BVIAA did not receive feedback and no matters were referred to 
HMC. A process is in place for when large cash amounts are detected, with the 
passenger detained until a customs officer arrives to take control.  
11.88 The BVIAA maintains manual and electronic records of security breaches, detention 
of contraband, seizure of undeclared goods and detection and interception of 
smuggling. These are normally recorded and filed daily and reports are prepared. 
They are easily retrievable and there is a backup system in place.  
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the BVI Airports Authority  
T 
 
Inability to detect security breaches effectively may enable smuggling of goods and 
other criminal activities. 
 
Insufficient cooperation between BVIAA and HMC and RVIPF makes it difficult to 
identify, seize and prosecute cash couriers. 
V

11.89 The BVI Ports Authority (BVIPA) is responsible for the Virgin Islands’ seven ports: 
five domestic and international passenger terminals, one cruise port and one cargo 
facility.31  
11.90 The main areas for improvement are training, cooperation with other LEAs, port 
security, risk assessment and risk rating system, records management, governance 
and operations. These are set out in more detail below. 
11.91 A Board of Directors, which meets monthly, determines the BVIPA’s policy direction 
and oversees its administration and management. The Managing Director is 
normally responsible for daily management and administration, although at the time 
of review this reposed with the Deputy Managing Director. When interviewed for the 
NRA, the Managing Director deferred to senior officers, raising questions about 
leadership. 
11.92 The BVIPA has no internal written policies, procedures or guidelines, but the BVI 
Ports Authority Regulations, 1995 cover the management and functioning of port 
facilities and penalties for any breaches. 
11.93 Staffing appears adequate. Numbers grew in the review period by 23 per cent, from 
145 in 2011 to 179 in 2014. This was mainly in non-managerial staff. Throughout 
the review period, the BVIPA had five vehicles, one boat, 65 cameras, ten handheld 
scanners and four archway scanners. 
11.94 Vessels are scheduled in advance to berth and must radio for permission before 
they can dock. There are security guards and dockmasters at all ports of entry. HMC 
is the first point of contact for clearing vessels but dockmasters also witness the 
offloading, which involves the BVIPA in undertaking due diligence on vessels. For 
                                                          
31 The five passenger terminals are in West End and Road Town on Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, and Gun 
Creek and St Thomas Bay on Virgin Gorda; the cruise port is at Tortola Pier Park; and the cargo facility is 
at Port Purcell on Tortola.  
 
70 
 
vessels wishing to operate within the Territory, the BVIPA carries out physical 
inspections and confirms with the VISR the vessels are registered and insured.  
11.95 Security and other enforcement staff are trained in screening passengers and 
securing ports of entry but not in investigative techniques, including those related to 
ML/TF and smuggling. They did not generally understand the FATF 
Recommendations or the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime 
specifically as regards smuggling and there was no procedure for addressing this. 
Officers follow the BVI Ports Authority Regulations, 1990 and the BVI Ports Authority 
Act, 1990 but would benefit from formal training on interpretation, application and 
implementation. 
11.96 The BVIPA has fully assessed its own security needs. All ports comply with the 
International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, based on a threat assessment in 
November 2014 which included the possibility of terrorism. Code certification is valid 
to December 2019 and the current security plan was approved by the UK 
Department for Transport. There were 32 security officers across all ports during the 
review period, 15 at Port Purcell. The BVIPA said they were hiring ten more.  
11.97 All CCTV systems can store up to 30 days of surveillance footage, after which this 
must be disposed of. CCTV is maintained by the BVIPA’s Information Technology 
Department and two security officers are trained to use it. The BVIPA has employed 
CCTV to assist the RVIPF on several occasions.  
11.98 There is no evidence of corruption despite the absence of measures to mitigate this. 
Measures are also not apparent to deter external interference, which the BVIPA 
feels it does not have the power to counter. While the BVIPA seeks to identify 
actions that might have resulted from interference, it could be clearer about what is 
done with the findings (in one instance, there was political and interest group 
interference with collecting harbour charges from some cargo vessels, with attempts 
made to usurp the BVIPA’s authority and even withdraw staff from a port). To avoid 
any risk of goods passing through ports that may stem from predicate offences 
involving ML/TF, it would be useful to introduce formal policies and procedures and 
adhere fully to informal ones.  
11.99 The BVIPA sees a limited role for itself in smuggling and seizure, and does not 
appear to have procedures to detect smuggling, including of migrants and goods. It 
sees its responsibility as ensuring vessels are authorised to land and HMC as being 
responsible for the cargo’s contents and any seizure. It verifies cargo where HMC 
had concerns and reports undeclared goods to HMC. While it routinely discovers 
undeclared goods and cash, BVIPA does not record numbers, types or dates and 
there is no evidence of seizure or other action. 
11.100 There do not appear to be any cooperation problems between HMC and the BVIPA. 
An established MoU enables regular referrals. In the review period, the BVIPA said 
it referred one matter to HMC while HMC said three were referred, which may 
suggest a discrepancy in record keeping. Cooperation with the RVIPF appears less 
 
71 
 
strong: both are IGC signatories but do not have their own MoU and have made no 
referrals to each other. The BVIPA can levy its own fines and usually deals with 
legislative breaches internally, particularly non-payment of fees. It is not clear what 
would happen if a matter required referral to the RVIPF or another LEA. 
11.101 The BVIPA maintains records on the evasion of port duties, but as mentioned not 
for the seizure of undeclared goods or interception of smuggling. Paper records are 
kept for at least seven years. Making the records easily retrievable and having a 
backup system would facilitate trend analysis, cooperation and requests for 
information.  
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the BVI Ports Authority  
T 
 
Government and other political interference.

Ability of criminals such as migrant smugglers, human traffickers and money 
launderers to carry out their activities through the ports without much hindrance 
given the level of AML/CFT training, records management and internal policies and 
procedures. 
V 
 
The lack of written procedures to check against and prevent interference from carrying 
out the BVIPA’s legislative mandate to the fullest extent;   
 
Lack of written procedures for detecting smuggled and undeclared goods and in 
detecting and preventing ML and TF activities by users of the ports; 
 
Lack of training in basic investigative techniques, in AML/CFT and the UN Convention 
against Transnational Organised Crime (as regards smuggling).

11.102 The Magistrate’s Court (MC) presides over and decides mainly summary criminal 
matters, minor civil claims and certain family law matters. It also has limited 
jurisdiction over maritime salvage and wrecks and serves as the licensing authority 
for granting liquor licenses. 
11.103 The MC does a good job in safeguarding its independence but physical security 
would benefit from improvement, as would staff AML/CFT training (see 11.109 and 
11.110 below). 
11.104 As regards governance, the MC is headed by the Senior Magistrate, who oversees 
the other magistrates and the MC’s day-to-day functioning, assisted by the Court 
 
72 
 
Manager. The MC falls under the executive branch of government and the Senior 
Magistrate consults with and reports to the Deputy Governor’s Office (DGO) about 
key administrative decisions. The DGO exercises oversight through periodic 
reviews, and any shortcomings are discussed between senior MC staff and the 
DGO’s Permanent Secretary. The DGO approves the budget and staff training. 
11.105 Although the Virgin Islands judiciary comes within the structure of the Eastern 
Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC), the ECSC’s Chief Justice does not have 
administrative oversight or day-to-day decision-making authority in and 11.110 
related to the MC. Her role appears to be restricted to recommending the 
appointment by the Governor of the Senior Magistrate and other magistrates: she 
chairs the Judicial and Legal Services Commission (JLSC), which makes 
recommendations for all public legal appointments in the Virgin Islands to the 
Governor, who takes the final decision.  
11.106 For the MC to fall under the executive branch departs from the norm in many 
Commonwealth countries, where the magistracy falls under the judiciary proper. The 
system, however, appears to work well even if it does not give the desired 
appearance of judicial independence. It might arguably make the MC less efficient, 
e.g. by withholding resources or not providing court reporters or adequate security. 
There is no real evidence of this, although the absence of court reporters and the 
fact that magistrates still record proceedings manually means justice is dispensed 
less speedily.  
11.107 There are 16 employees operating two MCs in Tortola (at John’s Hole and 
Prospect Reef) and one in Virgin Gorda. The Senior Magistrate sits in John’s Hole, 
as do most administrative staff. A lack of resources (human and non-human) 
requires most staff to work extra time every day to ensure the MC’s administrative 
side runs smoothly in tandem with the judicial work. The Case Manager, 
Administrative Officer, Court Clerks and Senior Magistrate’s Secretary have to be 
dedicated to the court on a daily basis.  
11.108 The MC subscribes to the ECSC’s Judicial Enforcement Management System 
(JEMS). This can track all court cases from filing to completion and provide statistical 
data. The Clerks and the Case Manager are responsible for updating records and 
tracking case requests and queries. The lack of human resources means JEMS 
cannot be used optimally and affects records maintenance and management. 
11.109 An orderly provides security in the courtrooms during court sessions. At John’s 
Hole only, security cameras are installed on the court buildings, office access is 
restricted by key cards and people must pass through a metal detector before 
entering the courtroom. However, there is no physical security for court premises. 
ECSC policies state that security should be provided to all members of the judiciary 
but the RVIPF withdrew the police officers assigned to magistrates in September 
 
73 
 
2014, apparently due to lack of resources.32 This may affect the proper and effective 
administration of justice.  
11.110 Virgin Islands magistrates benefit from the ECSC’s periodic training for magistrates 
in the OECS region. This generally covers judicial ethics, court independence and 
court administration. There is also periodic training for bailiffs and court 
administration staff. Although summary matters may have AML/CFT dimensions, 
magistrates other than the Senior Magistrate receive no AML/CFT training. They do 
not appear up to date with the FATF Recommendations or Methodology or the 
CFATF mutual evaluation process. While there is also no evidence of specific 
training on conflicts of interest or corruption, it is assumed this falls within the training 
on judicial ethics and court independence. 
11.111 During the review period, there was no evidence of conflicts of interest which had 
compromised the MC’s work or integrity or had the potential to do so. There is no 
formal policy other than general public service rules and the MC appears to operate 
an honour system, whereby staff disclose any conflicts as and when they arise. At 
the time of the review, a manual was being developed to include handling conflicts 
of interest.  
11.112 The MC does not seem to suffers from external interference (e.g. from the 
executive, counsel, litigants or witnesses). This is despite a perception that because 
it comes under the executive, the MC is susceptible to political interference, 
especially over its budget and staffing. In practice, the MC operates without political 
interference and the magistrates jealously guard their independence. The Senior 
Magistrate’s direct contact with the DGO is at best minimal. The Office Manager 
acts as a buffer, liaising regularly with the DGO but only for administrative matters. 
11.113 Complaints about staff are generally dealt with internally but may be escalated to 
the DGO. Complaints about a Magistrate’s performance are likely to be advanced 
to the Chief Justice. The MC does not have written policy or procedures for handling 
complaints. Where discipline is warranted, the case may be referred to the Judicial 
and Legal Services Commission. During the review period, there was one conflict of 
interest complaint, which was dealt with internally, did not warrant escalating and 
did not compromise the MC. 
11.114 There is no evidence of any bribery or corruption of any MC administrative staff. 
Although they are not specifically trained in identifying and forestalling this, the 
public service rules require staff to conduct themselves so as not to bring the service 
into disrepute. There is acknowledgement that specific training would help to 
strengthen this.  
11.115 The Chief Justice is also the President of the Court of Appeal and with other 
appellate judges hears appeals arising from decisions of the MC and the High Court. 
Senior MC officers prepare records of appeals and submit these to the High Court 
Registry under the Senior Magistrate’s direction. Resource shortages are delaying 
                                                          
32 This facility was restored in 2016.

the preparation of appeal records, which affects the timeliness of submissions to the 
Court of Appeal. 
11.116 As a part of Government’s judicial arm, the MC understandably maintains a high 
degree of independence from institutions outside the judiciary and does not have 
any formal cooperation agreements with these.33 However, it cooperates informally 
with the RVIPF to perform its functions, and the RVIPF provides the court orderly. 
11.117 As regards records, magistrates take manual notes of court proceedings which are 
later transposed. Introducing court reporters would speed matters up. The MC said 
it was purchasing a digital recording system expected to be in place by 2015 (this 
has not yet happened). This would require additional competent staff.  
11.118 The MC’s work is increasing without a commensurate increase in resources, such 
as those required to use JEMS optimally. However, JEMS does produce statistical 
data on the number of cases heard, acquittals and convictions. Sensible changes 
made include ending the practice in 2013 of recording multiple charges against the 
same person separately.  
11.119 Payment of fines above US$5,000 must be by cashier’s cheque. No CDD 
information is collected for fines below $5,000. By reducing physical cash held, the 
MC is less of a target for criminals and large payments are traceable to individuals 
and possibly their source. However, the lack of physical security for MC premises 
makes it riskier to accept cash for fines below $5,000. 
11.120 The record management system would benefit from reform and modernisation. 
The Court Manager is responsible for file handling and the only person trained to do 
so. While this appears to work well, this may pose a risk in the event of her absence, 
although it was indicated that a person was being identified to take over some of the 
Court Manager’s role. Physical files were said to have disappeared but there were 
no records of this. For electronic records, the MC relies on the Government’s IT 
infrastructure and would benefit from protocols governing the Government IT 
Department’s access to the MC. Areas for improvement include being able to 
retrieve historical data to analyse trends in summary offences and identify any 
reforms needed.  
Main threats (T) and vulnerabilities (V) identified for the Magistrate’s Court  
T 
 
Absence of adequate security for the Magistrates and the MC premises may 
threaten the judicial system at the MC level. 
 
Absence of knowledge and training on AML/CFT matters may affect prosecution and 
conviction of ML/TF offences and hinder confiscation of proceeds. 
V 
 
Lack of sufficient human resources may impede adequate utilisation of the JEMS 
system and timely processing and submission of appeal records.

cases with other LEAs. 
 
 
75 
 
 
The absence of court reporters creates inefficiencies in the speedy processing of 
cases on trial. 
 
Failings in the records management system inhibit the MC from undertaking a 
proper trend analysis of criminal prosecutions before the court in order to assess 
where greater resources are needed. 
The judiciary: Supreme (High) Court 
11.121 The HC has three judges, one dedicated to the ESCS’s Commercial Division 
based in the Virgin Islands and two dealing mostly with criminal and civil matters. 
HC decisions are appealable to and heard by the Court of Appeal; if a party is then 
not satisfied they can appeal further to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

11.122 In order not to hinder international cooperation, a clear opportunity for 
improvement lies in the HC’s appreciation of ML/TF issues and how the Court fits 
into the Territory’s AML/CFT landscape (see 11.130 below). Enhancements to the 
timing and processing of court matters would also be beneficial (see 11.126  and 
11.132 below). 
11.123 The Chief Justice appoints HC and Court of Appeal judges on the ECSC JLSC’s 
advice. While the Court of Appeal visits and sits in all of its nine member 
jurisdictions, including the BVI, the Chief Justice assigns HC judges to specific 
jurisdictions. The Chief Justice provides strategic direction for the entire judiciary 
and issues Practice Directions from time to time.  
11.124 The HC’s Registrar reports to the DGO for day-to-day administration and to the 
ECSC’s Chief Registrar for legal and judicial matters. Each authority respects its 
area of responsibility and works to ensure the smooth functioning of the HC.  
11.125 Eight court reporters record HC court proceedings. One of these normally covers 
the proceedings of the Virgin Islands House of Assembly when it sits and this does 
not appear to impede the HC’s work. 
11.126 Cases normally take 12 to 18 months to determine. Delays may occur with more 
complex criminal matters, often due to scheduling conflicts. The ODPP attributes 
this to the limited number of criminal defence lawyers in the Territory; the problem 
might also suggest improvements needed in how lawyers prepare. On occasion, 
judges themselves take extended periods to deliver judgements.  
 
76 
 
11.127 The HC has 46 staff, of which 21 are in senior positions. Sixteen are assigned to 
the Commercial Court, which does not deal with criminal matters. The Registrar is 
assisted by two Deputy Registrars and all are legal practitioners.  
11.128 HC judges sit in Tortola. The number of Registry staff appears sufficient. The HC 
subscribes to JEMS and all Registry staff are familiar with this and use it regularly. 
11.129 In place of a formal training programme, the HC Registry conducts some selective 
training, such as ML/TF training for the Registrar in 2013. Some judges have 
participated in conferences and symposia with an AML/CFT element. In 2013, the 
FSC and ECSC co-sponsored AML/CFT training for ECSC judges in Anguilla. 
11.130 The Registry would benefit from having a better appreciation of its relevance to the 
Virgin Islands’ AML/CFT regime. It has limited understanding of the FATF 
Recommendations and Methodology in relation to international cooperation and 
processing MLA requests, even though legislation such as the Criminal Justice 
(International Cooperation) Act, 1993 (CJ(IC)A) and the PCCA grants the HC 
jurisdiction over certain applications for restraint, confiscation and charging orders, 
to which the FATF Recommendations have a nexus.  
11.131 No cash is collected at the Registry and there was no evidence in the review period 
that any HC staff were engaged in bribery or corruption. However, staff receive no 
formal training in this or in conflicts of interest; instead the public service code and 
general orders are relied on. If a judge or the Registrar and her deputies are found 
wanting in ethical conduct, they may be subject to disciplinary proceedings leading 
to removal from office.  
11.132 For appeals, senior Registry officers prepare records and submit these to the 
ECSC Chief Registrar for the Court of Appeal judges. Officers are properly 
supervised to ensure confidentiality. Delays in preparing the records, especially on 
criminal matters, affects the period of disposition of appeals. This may be a question 
of management rather than resources. 
11.133 Like the MC, the HC understandably maintains a high degree of independence 
from institutions outside the judiciary and does not have any formal cooperation 
agreements with these.34 The HC is responsible for facilitating the service of foreign 
documents in the Virgin Islands and cooperates with other judicial authorities on 
this, using a standard form to streamline the process. Servicing foreign documents 
normally takes no more than 30 days unless the documents need to be translated. 
Clarity about how many such requests were received over the review period and 
how many would have had an ML/TF nexus would help identify how the Virgin 
Islands is meeting its international obligations. 
                                                          
34 In 2016, the HC Registry acceded to the IGC MOU for the exchange of information in appropriate 
cases with other LEAs. 
 
 
77 
 
11.134 The RVIPF informally assigns police officers to the HC during criminal court 
proceedings, providing police orderlies for all the judges. Statute defines how the 
HC cooperates with the AGC, FIA, ODPP and FSC for specified matters over which 
it has jurisdiction.  
11.135 The HC keeps records and files in physical form and there appears to be limited 
electronic storage of statistical data. Although they use JEMS, which is linked to the 
ECSC, staff keep independent records of their case files. There do not appear to be 
written policies for ML/TF data collection and the HC maintains limited statistical 
data about predicate offences and ML/TF prosecutions, convictions and acquittals. 
This inhibits analysis of trends that may result in useful reforms. The only security 
risk that could be assessed was file storage, to which the public have access, which 
poses a risk. 
 
 
 
78 
 
12. Freezing, seizures, confiscation and forfeiture 
Legislative framework 
12.1 FATF Recommendation Four requires measures to be in place which enable 
competent authorities to identify, evaluate and trace assets subject to confiscation 
and carry out provisional measures, including seizing and freezing to prevent any 
dealing, transfer or disposal of such property. Recommendation 38 requires 
countries to have the authority to take expeditious action in response to international 
requests to coordinate the seizing, freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of 
criminal conduct. Recommendation 33 requires that countries should maintain 
comprehensive statistics on, among other things, property frozen, seized or 
confiscated. 
12.2 The Virgin Islands has a robust AML/CFT regime and effective legislative framework 
in place for this (see box below). This is strengthened by the requirement for the 
RVIPF, ODPP, AGC, HMC and FIA to coordinate domestically and across borders 
in the freezing, seizure, confiscation and forfeiture of criminal proceeds. This 
ensures that asset tracing and financial investigations are appropriately conducted. 
12.3 The NRA assessed Virgin Islands authorities against the legislation and the criteria 
below.  
 Facilitating effective freezing, seizure, confiscation and forfeiture by 
ensuring that: foreign counterparts can easily identify points of contact; legal 
frameworks enable informal information exchange; and procedures enable 
spontaneous information sharing for asset tracing and financial investigations; 
and by entering into asset sharing agreements. 
 Minimizing structural impediments by: allocating resources for expert, 
dedicated personnel trained in financial investigation; having mechanisms to 
coordinate asset tracing and financial investigations; having mechanisms for 
real-time joint law enforcement and prosecution (especially for cross-border 
requests); streamlining asset tracing and financial investigations so as to handle 
requests in a timely manner and monitor their execution; and reducing 
bureaucracy around formal requests by encouraging all parties to acknowledge 
that action is being taken.  
 
 
 
79 
 
 Legislative framework for freezing, seizures, confiscation and forfeiture 
 
Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1992 (DTOA). Sections 5 and 8 empower the Court to 
issue orders to confiscate proceeds related to drug trafficking offences. Section 34 
permits HMC or the RVIPF to seize cash found in the Virgin Islands to the value of 
$10,000 or more which is suspected to be drug trafficking proceeds or for use in drug 
trafficking or ML. Section 23 (1) enables the confiscation of any property which 
represents drug trafficking proceeds. Section 35 enables the Magistrate to order the 
forfeiture of any cash seized under section 34 where the Police or HMC suspect that it 
is intended for drug trafficking. Section 35A provides for any drug trafficking or drug 
money laundering proceeds to be forfeited, whether or not the defendant is convicted. 
 
Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997 (PCCA). Section 6 enables the Court to 
make confiscation orders following a conviction. Section 32 facilitates external 
confiscation orders and proceedings in a designated country. Section 34 provides for 
forfeiture of any real property or means of transport following a conviction for using, 
concealing or transferring criminal proceeds or helping another to benefit from these, 
and for the defendant to pay a sum or suffer imprisonment. Cash which is undeclared 
but detected, or which derives from or is used for a crime, can be seized by HMC or the 
RVIPF under Section 37A and forfeiture is generally conducted under Section 37B. 
 
Criminal Justice (International Co-Operation) Act, 1993 (CJICA).  Section 7 provides 
for international cooperation in enforcing overseas forfeiture orders for any offence 
under the DPMA or drug trafficking offences in Section 2 of the DTOA. Sections 10(6), 
11(1) and (2), and 12(1) provide for international cooperation in confiscating drug 
trafficking proceeds. 
 
Anti-Terrorism (Financial and Other Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2002. 
This provides for the enforcement of forfeiture orders for money or other property likely 
to be used for terrorism, proceeds from committing terrorism and proceeds of acts 
carried out for terrorism purposes. 
 
These measures are supported by the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act (Cap. 178) 
(DPMA). While it does not specifically deal with ML, this empowers the court to order, 
following a drugs conviction, forfeiture of the drugs and any related transport. For drug 
trafficking, the court may order the forfeiture of any related valuable consideration, 
including property derived from the proceeds. 
 
 
 
 
80 
 
Royal Virgin Islands Police Force 
12.4 The Royal Virgin Islands Police Force (RVIPF) is governed by the Police Act and 
exercises other powers under the DTOA, CJ(IC)A, PCCA and DPMA. It can 
investigate predicate offences, including ML, and apply to the courts for an order to 
freeze, seize, forfeit or confiscate cash, property or other assets suspected or 
established to be linked to proceeds of crime.  
12.5 Within the RVIPF, the FCU advises on and conducts all financial crime 
investigations, including freezing and confiscation. It has policies on asset seizure 
and cash seizure under section 6 (2) of the Police Act (Cap. 165). The overall RVIFP 
would benefit from having similar policies and procedures. 
12.6 The FCU’s asset seizure policy covers all assets apart from cash under the PCCA, 
DTOA, DPMA and Customs Management and Duties Act, 2010 (CMDA). Assets 
used in committing a criminal offence may either be seized and forfeited or identified 
for confiscation.  
12.7 The FCU takes responsibility for cash seized by Customs and it has a seizure policy 
which covers cash of at least $10,000 under the PCCA, DTOA, DPMA and CMDA. 
A cash seizure may trigger criminal proceedings and seized funds are deposited in 
a government bank account until criminal proceedings begin. Following a conviction, 
the cash may be confiscated as the proceeds of criminal conduct. While the cash 
seizure policy does not address cash of less than $10,000, the police may seize 
smaller amounts where they suspect criminal activity and the court may confiscate 
these.  
12.8 An area for improvement is how to record and identify cash for investigative 
purposes. Data provided by the RVIPF as a whole and by the FCU to the NRA show 
differences in what is presented and how for various types of forfeiture and seizure 
(see comparative table below of aggregate data on forfeitures and seizures).  
12.9 The FCU suggested that procedural rules accounted for the disparity in the RVIPF’s 
numbers for cash forfeitures and the FCU’s for cash seizures. However, it is likely 
to be because of separate, unreconciled systems. The RVIPF’s information would 
benefit from being specific, checked and updated, with data entry made mandatory 
and information on predicate offences entered consistently. The FCU’s own 
database records more information and records on spreadsheets, including drug 
amounts seized if the FCU is aware of the case. 
12.10 Data could be designed in a manner that avoids or explains the disparity. To ensure 
identification of risks, training and improved guidance would be helpful to ensure 
that information is appropriately categorized, recorded and easily retrievable and 
that management and analysis are prioritized. It would also be useful to clarify the 
relationship between the FCU and the RVIPF and assure the FCU of sufficient 
priority and resources.

12.11 While the RVIPF has suggested the legislation is not sufficiently robust on civil 
forfeiture and confiscation as it only addresses criminal forfeiture, the risk 
assessment or crime data analysis underpinning this is not clear. The FCU’s asset 
seizure policy enables non-cash assets identified for confiscation to be seized under 
the PCCA and DTOA. The wider RVIPF lacks effective procedures for referring ML 
cases and other financial crime to the FCU. 
12.12 As regards international and inter-agency cooperation, as noted at 11.59 above, 
there is an opportunity to improve the RVIPF’s MoU with the FIA for processing 
 
82 
 
Interpol requests, with concrete policies and procedures for handling these. It would 
also be helpful for the RVIPF to have written procedures for facilitating intra-agency 
cooperation to avoid inconsistency, restrictions and lack of coordination in sharing 
information between its own departments, notably the FCU and CID. 
12.13 More effective investigation would help avoid difficulties with confiscation of the 
proceeds of crime where the proceeds have been passed to third parties, as would 
addressing the PCCA’s lack of clarity here. 
Her Majesty’s Customs  
12.14 Her Majesty’s Customs (HMC) is governed by the Customs Management and Duties 
Act, 2010 (CMDA). This and other statutes, including the DTOA and PCCA, permit 
forfeiture by detaining and seizing goods, including vessels, and the condemnation 
of contraband. Officers are not held personally liable.  
12.15 In line with FATF Recommendation 32, which requires countries to implement a 
declaration or disclosure system for incoming and outgoing cross border 
transportation of currency and bearer negotiable instruments, a declaration system 
requires disclosure when moving $10,000 or more in or out of the BVI. Penalties for 
failing to declare range from cash forfeiture to fines and imprisonment. In the review 
period, HMC recorded no outgoing declarations or related cash seizures. There 
were five false incoming declarations (out of 3,120,268 declarations) and a total of 
$485,839 seized. Twelve arrests were made, of which six resulted in prosecutions 
and one resulted in conviction and forfeiture. Following the NRA, an outgoing 
seizure was made in 2015 and HMC implemented a new form for outgoing 
declarations.  
12.16 Detected undeclared cash must be counted in the presence of the person carrying 
it. The FCU investigates the source and legitimacy of detected funds.  
12.17 Declaration forms are the only written procedures for detecting or seizing bulk cash. 
Better training, including in identifying signs and detection of suspicious persons, 
would ensure that measures to detect cash smugglers and bulk cash movements 
are effective. Another area for improvement is analysis of cash declarations made, 
including the sharing of declaration trends and issues with the FIA for analysis in 
line with FATF Recommendation 32, and HMC analysis to identify AML/CFT trends 
and typologies. 
12.18 People who fail to make proper declarations or who make false declarations have 
the option of signing an “Admission of Guilt” form to avoid prosecution. There are 
no written procedures on how HMC should use this form. HMC stated that the CMDA 
(section 126) empowered them to compound an offence, stay proceedings or 
restore anything seized (except with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, drug 
smuggling, and weapons and firearms smuggling).  
 
83 
 
12.19 HMC claimed this was generally used for breaches such as failure to check a vessel 
in or out when entering or leaving the Territory, evading customs duty, commercial 
fraud, and violation of the Cruising Permit Ordinance (Cap. 203). From the data, it 
is not clear whether or how HMC used this power or if as a matter of routine the 
penalties imposed were lower than if the breaches had gone to court. 
12.20 It is not clear that HMC data for other crimes reflects the scale of the problem. In the 
review period, records shows eight drug seizures, for which 14 people were 
arrested; seven seizures of other illegal or restricted items, for which two people 
were arrested; and one vessel seized in relation to a cash seizure. There were no 
seizures of banned substances or counterfeit items and no vessels seized for human 
trafficking or migrant smuggling. Addressing inconsistencies in ODPP and RVIPF 
data would clarify whether seizures were effective and led to, or were the result of, 
investigation and prosecution. 
12.21 HMC usually responds directly to international cooperation requests. As noted in 
Section 11, it does not set a timeframe but stated it responded efficiently and there 
were no outstanding requests for the review period. In the absence of records, it is 
not possible to verify how many cooperation requests were received or responded 
to and in what timeframe. No staff were assigned to international cooperation in 
2011 or 2013. Other than the IGC, HMC does not have written procedures for 
international or domestic cooperation. 
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions 
12.22 The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) is responsible for initiating 
or undertaking confiscation proceedings for cash forfeiture. There was no evidence 
of an active pursuit of confiscations during the review period even though the 
possibility existed based on the number of predicate offences prosecuted and 
convictions secured. 
12.23 The ODPP explained that, for confiscation, the Crown needed to prove beyond 
reasonable doubt that the monies or other assets were the proceeds of criminal 
conduct. It could not do this in the absence of investigations and evidence from the 
RVIPF, and the PCCA did not have provision for the reverse burden of proof as the 
UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 does. Yet section 6 (9) of the PCCA does provide 
for proof triggering a confiscation order to be established on a balance of 
probabilities rather beyond reasonable doubt.  
12.24 The absence of confiscations appeared due to a focus by investigators and 
prosecutors on conviction rather than asset confiscation; and to a lack of procedures 
for confiscating the proceeds of crime, coordination between the RVIPF and the 
ODPP, ODPP guidance for police investigators on identifying ML in preparing cases 
for prosecution, and training for investigators and prosecutors in asset recovery, 
asset restraint, confiscation and forfeiture. 
 
84 
 
12.25 Although the ODPP arranged some training in 2013 and 2014 for its staff, the RVIPF 
and other relevant LEAs on asset recovery, confiscation and forfeiture, more 
effective training could ensure greater pursuit of confiscation orders. 
12.26 Coordination between the ODPP and the RVIPF could be improved to ensure that 
promising ML confiscation matters are investigated, leading to successful 
confiscation proceedings. 
12.27 Clear written guidelines and procedures on initiating and pursuing confiscation 
matters in relation to predicate offences would assist the RVIPF in pursuing and 
discovering property that might be related to predicate offences.  
12.28 There appears to be more flexibility in relation to forfeiture of property. Under the 
DTOA (section 35A (2)), the court can order this for the proceeds of drug trafficking 
or drug money laundering irrespective of whether a defendant is convicted. A similar 
if not equivalent provision is in the PCCA (section 37B (3)), whereby the court may 
order cash forfeiture irrespective of whether proceedings begin against a defendant 
for an offence related to the cash. The ODPP would like to see legal provision in the 
Virgin Islands for non-conviction-based confiscation, civil confiscation or civil 
forfeiture. 
Financial Investigation Agency 
12.29 The Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) is a statutory body established under the 
FIAA. Various other pieces of legislation confer further functions and powers on it 
relating to ML/TF and other financial crime and intelligence gathering.  
12.30 The FIA plays a minimal role in ML investigations. It gathers intelligence and 
supports other CAs and LEAs with international cooperation, and it refers suspected 
ML/TF cases to the RVIPF’s FCU. This includes receiving and analysing 
SARs/STRs and sending any findings to CAs and LEAs for further action, including 
criminal investigation by the RVIPF.  
12.31 When it suspects they may be the proceeds of crime, the FIA has the power to 
freeze funds for two periods of 72 hours. To have the funds frozen for longer, the 
RVIPF and ODPP would make a court application. The FIA did not take any 
temporary freezing action during the review period. In previous years, it had worked 
with the AGC and RVIPF on international cooperation investigations into 
confiscation matters (the IPOC case).  
12.32 While the FIA is not directly responsible for initiating or pursuing confiscation, its 
work in receiving, analysing and disseminating intelligence makes it invaluable to 
the AML/CFT fight. It has broad powers to impose restrictions on transactions and 
other activities that may have some nexus to ML or PF35. It is therefore important 
for the FIA to continue cooperating with all the CAs and LEAs and assisting with 
                                                          
35 Under the Proliferation Financing (Prohibition) Act, 2009. 
 
85 
 
investigations to ensure successful initiation of confiscation proceedings by the 
ODPP. 
Attorney General’s Chambers  
12.33 The Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) is the central authority for mutual legal 
assistance requests under the MLA (USA) A and provides legal advice on requests 
under the CJ(IC)A, although the GO is the central authority there. That includes 
matters relating to the confiscation of property.  
12.34 The AGC has developed SOPs for MLA requests, including the enforcement of 
overseas forfeiture orders and confiscation orders. The CJ (IC) (EOFO) O sets out 
procedures for the courts to issue external forfeiture orders and restraint orders 
which prohibit people from dealing with any property liable to forfeiture.  
12.35 Under the SOPs, the AGC receives a MLA request from the GO (which logs the 
request) or directly from a foreign CA. If it complies with Virgin Islands law, the AGC 
forwards the request to the FIA, which investigates and responds to the AGC. Once 
the request has been satisfied, the AGC forwards the file to the GO to send to the 
requesting CA. 
12.36 The AGC has sufficient resources to process MLA and extradition requests 
effectively and on average three staff do so daily. In the review period, the AGC 
made four requests to freeze proceeds/assets of which two were granted, three 
applications to confiscate proceeds/assets which were refused, four applications to 
forfeit proceeds/drugs/illegal/restricted goods of which one was granted, and one 
application for a restraint order which was refused. 
12.37 The freezing requests related to bank accounts involving bribery. As the foreign CA 
did not communicate the outcome (e.g. prosecution and conviction), the AGC could 
not confirm whether the order remained in place. 
12.38 In some cases, MLA requests to confiscate proceeds could not be executed 
because they did not identify the assets or show that they represented the proceeds 
of crime. The AGC said it explained this to overseas CAs.  
12.39 As a signatory to the IGC MoU, the AGC had coordinated with LEAs over successful 
MLAT requests but had not needed assistance with requests relating to freezing, 
confiscation and forfeiture. Cooperation between the AGC, GO, FIA and ODPP 
could have been more effective over the review period. The maintenance of 
consistent records would have enabled a true picture of processed MLA requests to 
be provided, especially in relation to seizures, freezing, confiscation and forfeiture 
orders.

13. Terrorist financing and proliferation financing 
 
13.1 The FATF defines terrorist financing as the financing of terrorist acts and of terrorism 
and terrorist organisations. This usually derives from criminal activities, misuse of 
charitable organisations (e.g. NPOs) and people directly donating their own funds.  
Disruption requires input from LEAs, CAs and all AML/CFT stakeholders. In the BVI, 
the agencies responsible are the RVIPF, ODPP, GO, AGC, FIA, FSC and ITA.  
13.2 The RVIPF is responsible for investigating TF, the FIA for investigations (including 
analysing SARs/STRs and providing intelligence to the RVIPF), the ODPP for 
prosecuting TF, and the GO and AGC for ensuring the MLA regime can assist 
foreign authorities. As supervisors, the FIA and FSC ensure that reporting entities 
carry out AML/CFT measures to avoid abuse of the financial system.  
13.3 LEAs and other CAs consider the TF risk in the Territory relatively remote and low. 
As the size and nature of the financial services industry provide some risk of it being 
used to finance terrorists or their activities, the Virgin Islands focuses its mitigating 
measures on proper and adequate regulation and supervision of the industry, as 
described in this Report. The measures in place to detect and prevent ML are fully 
applicable to detecting and preventing TF. 
13.4 This means ensuring that high-risk areas, such as NPOs, are properly identified and 
supervised, and that everyone engaging in in financial services business is properly 
identified and verified, including all legal persons and legal arrangements. LEAs 
must be appropriately trained in detecting, investigating and prosecuting TF.  
13.5 The analysis set out in this Report suggests that there is some risk of TF through 
FIs, NPOs and DNFBPs, and that LEAs and CAs should be trained to detect, 
investigate and prosecute TF.  
13.6 The Virgin Islands’ measures to ensure the Territory meets its obligations to freeze 
identified terrorist assets without delay (e.g. under FATF Recommendation 60) 
include freezing assets upon request from a foreign authority. The Virgin Islands 
implements United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1373, which 
requires states to freeze terrorists’ assets and ensure their nationals cannot make 
funds and any related financial services available to terrorists. It also implements 
UNSCR 1267 on targeted sanctions against individuals and entities associated with 
Al Qaida, which requires freezing designated persons’ assets. One area for 
improvement is the frequency and timeliness of the circulation of materials and lists 
related to TF.  
Criminalisation of terrorist financing 
13.7 The Virgin Islands criminalises the financing of terrorism through the Terrorism 
(United Nations Measures)(Overseas Territories) Order 2001 (T(UNM)(OT)O), the 
 
87 
 
Anti-terrorism (Financing and Other Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2002 
(AT(FOM)(OT)O), and the  Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) 
(Overseas Territories) Order 2002, all in force. Section 6 of the AT(FOM)(OT)O 
prohibits persons from providing money or other property for the purposes of 
terrorism and defines “person” to include any corporation, either aggregate or sole, 
and any club, society, association or other body, of one or more persons. This 
covers financing of terrorist organisations and individual terrorists.  
13.8 There have been no TF investigations, prosecutions or convictions in the Territory 
during the period under review. 
Implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1267/1989 and 1988  
13.9 The Virgin Islands implements targeted financial sanctions pursuant to UN Security 
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1267/1989 and 1988 through the amended 
provisions of the PCCA and the T(UNM)(OT)O, and the AT(UNM)(OT)O. Together 
with the PCCA, these enable authorities to freeze the funds of designated persons 
and entities.  
13.10 The GO receives the UN Sanctions Committee’s periodic updates of undesirable 
persons and persons against whom sanctions should be maintained. It disseminates 
these to the AGC for publication in the Official Gazette. In addition, restrictive 
measures imposed by the EU against persons are enforced in the Territory through 
the GO. In accordance with article 5(1) of the T(UNM)(OT)O, the Governor may also 
order that, for a limited or unlimited period, funds are not to be made available to a 
designated or restricted person, except under the authority of a licence the Governor 
grants.  
13.11 In the review period, few licenses were requested and only one was granted. In 
2014, four licences were granted. The FIA and RVIPF enforce these orders with 
guidance from the AGC. To raise awareness of their obligation to seek licensing 
when conducting business for or with listed persons, industry practitioners were 
trained in 2015 on how and under what circumstances they could apply for a licence. 
13.12 Designations are published in the Official Gazette and on the FSC and FIA websites, 
and the FSC and FIA send copies electronically to businesses throughout the 
Territory. This takes 7-14 days and improvement is needed to ensure funds are 
identified and frozen without delay. 
13.13 During the review period, no persons or entities with links to the BVI were 
designated under UNSCRs 1267/1989 and 1988 or assets frozen. The licences 
granted by the Governor were in relation to EU restricted persons.  
 
88 
 
Implementation of UNSCR 1373  
13.14 The Virgin Islands implements UNSCR 1373 through the PCCA and the 
T(UNM)(OT)O, and AT(UNM)(OT)O. The GO receives and considers overseas 
requests and makes the relevant designations.  
13.15 The FIA and other LEAs can share information with the GO. With the Governor’s 
consent, they can also share information with other countries when requesting them 
to take freezing action under UNSCR 1373. The Virgin Islands has not requested 
any country to do so. 
13.16 Designations applicable to the Virgin Islands are generally made by the UNSC and 
EU, communicated through the GO and published by the AGC (in the Gazette) and 
by the FIA and FSC (on their websites). The FSC and FIA also send copies 
electronically to businesses throughout the Territory. The Virgin Islands did not 
freeze any assets under UNSCR 1373 during the review period. 
13.17 Failure to comply with sanctions under the relevant UK Orders in Council applicable 
to the Virgin Islands is an offence which may result in penalties on conviction. For 
the review period, no FIs or DNFBPs were in breach of their obligation to freeze the 
funds of designated persons and entities. Areas for improvement include ensuring 
that the industry has systems to identify if clients include persons on the list and, in 
addition to existing FSC onsite inspections, having systems to test for compliance 
by reporting entities.  
Implementation of UNSCR 2178  
13.18 The Virgin Islands has not criminalised the restrictions and prohibitions in UNSCR 
2178 in relation to foreign terrorist fighters. Authorities anticipate this will happen 
shortly. 
Criminalisation of proliferation financing 
13.19 As with TF, the risk of PF in the Virgin Islands is considered low and relatively 
remote. However, due to the nature of the financial services industry, some risk may 
exist of the misuse of corporate entities to fund weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD). The Proliferation Financing (Prohibition) Act, 2009 (PF(P)A) is a positive 
step. 
13.20 The PF(P)A gives the FIA the power to take action against persons and activities 
related to ML, TF or the development of WMD. The FIA may issue directions to a 
specific person or class of persons within a country where the UNSC or FATF have 
advised that measures should be taken because of the risks of TF, ML or 
proliferation activities being carried out by the government of that country or by 
persons resident or incorporated there.  The FIA may also issue directions where it 
reasonably believes the development or production of nuclear, radiological, 
 
89 
 
biological or chemical weapons, systems for their delivery, or anything that facilitates 
such development or production in the country, poses a significant risk to the Virgin 
Islands or UK’s interest. Outside the review period, the FIA published a direction in 
2009 and revoked it in 2010. 
13.21 Where a direction is given, persons may not enter into or continue to participate in 
specified transactions or business relationships with any person listed unless the 
FIA grants them a licence to do so. The FIA has not received any such requests. 
The PF(P)A also gives the FIA enforcement powers, which include the ability to 
request documents and to impose civil penalties. Criminal penalties may also be 
applied to persons failing to comply with a requirement imposed by a direction under 
the Act. 
13.22 As the current PF legislation is six years old and does not cover some elements of 
FATF Recommendation 7, it would be prudent for the legislation to be reviewed and 
where necessary amended. 
 
 
 
90 
 
14. Threats and consequences 
14.1 The NRA exercise has been helpful in highlighting the primary and secondary 
threats to be addressed in order to strengthen the Virgin Islands’ AML/CFT regime. 
14.2 A threat is something harmful which will not definitely happen but could happen if 
relevant action is not taken. ML/TF threats can come directly from people (natural 
and legal), generally criminals, terrorists and their facilitators. Or they can be 
indirect, where systems require improvement to detect, mitigate, combat and curtail 
harmful activity.  
14.3 Primary threats are those which, while not being certain to occur, have the most 
likelihood of happening if action is not taken. Secondary threats are less likely to 
occur. Both could affect the stability of the AML/CFT regime and the reputation of 
the Virgin Islands if they happened. We identify here the areas of improvement 
required to mitigate primary and secondary threats. 
Primary areas for improvement 
14.4 The ability of criminals to: 
 Avoid extradition where there are procedural failures in the extradition process 
 Retain proceeds of crime where there is inability to provide information through 
MLATs 
 Launder money and finance terrorism where international cooperation is not 
effective 
 Retain the proceeds of crime where sanctions are breached 
 Avoid prosecution where there is not proper investigation and coordination 
amongst LEAs 
 Unlawfully access and publish private and confidential information 
 Exploit any vulnerabilities in the MSB sector to launder money or finance 
terrorism  
 Engage in illegal gambling and lottery activity to launder the proceeds of crime. 
14.5 The need for LEAs to: 
 Pursue migrant smugglers, human traffickers, money launderers and other 
criminals 
 Conduct ML/TF investigations in a timely manner 
 Pursue prosecution for ML/TF offences 
 Pursue confiscation of assets 
 Properly detect security breaches 
 
91 
 
 Have measures in place to tackle internal corruption so that illegal activities are 
not overlooked or investigations frustrated or circumvented 
14.6 Any inadequate and inappropriate supervisory and enforcement frameworks for FIs 
and DNFBPs that could lead to abuse of these systems by criminals. 
14.7 Any TCSP negligence or complicity that might result in facilitating ML/TF. 
14.8 FIAs’ ability to process SARs/STRs in a timely and efficient manner so as not to 
cause delays in investigations, both locally and internationally, which would mean 
criminals avoiding prosecution and a breakdown in the Virgin Islands’ relationship 
with its international cooperation partners. 
14.9 Any misuse of financial services products such as legal persons, legal arrangements 
and money services by criminals to facilitate fraud, corruption and other financial 
crimes and to launder money and finance terrorism. 
14.10 Any failures by financial institutions and DNFBPs to maintain and record information 
on BO and third parties that could allow ML/TF activity to go undetected. 
14.11 Any inadequate AML/CFT knowledge or training by law enforcement officers and 
prosecutors that could inadvertently cause important elements to be overlooked in 
prosecuting ML/T. 
14.12 Any misuse of the real estate sector that might facilitate the laundering of proceeds 
of crime. 
14.13 Any exploitation of legal professionals that could facilitate criminal behaviour and 
the laundering of criminal proceeds. 
Secondary areas for improvement 
14.14 Any misuse of the local NPO sector to facilitate ML/TF where NPOs may be affiliated 
with international outreach. 
14.15 Any exploitation of the jewellery subsector by visitors, particularly those travelling in 
groups, that could facilitate ML through the purchase and subsequent re-sale of 
expensive jewellery. 
14.16 Any absence of proper CDD and record-keeping measures around the purchase, 
sale and rental of yachts and other high value goods, which could be used to 
facilitate ML. 
14.17 Any security weaknesses in the courts which could enable criminals to threaten or 
manipulate the judicial system. 
 
92 
 
Consequences  
14.18 Knowing and understanding the consequences of ineffective action against ML/TF 
is fundamental to formulating appropriate policies. We set some consequences out 
here. They may be short or long term, with a limited or general impact on the 
Territory’s business environment, national and international interests, reputation, 
attractiveness for financial services and trade relations (including correspondent 
banking relationships). They may raise safety and stability concerns which could 
affect the tourism and social services sectors. And they could lead to reduced 
funding for social and infrastructural development due to falling revenues.  
14.19 Reputational damage   
 Ineffective policing and border security could potentially lead to the Territory 
being labelled as facilitating ML/TF or not doing enough to tackle it. 
 Any rise in criminality could affect the Territory as a tourist destination and a 
preferred centre for international business transactions. 
 If the judiciary did not have the resources to dispense justice in a timely manner, 
this could reduce confidence in the judicial system and in the Territory as an 
important international finance centre. 
14.20 Economic damage 
 If lawyers, accountants and real estate agents could not mitigate their ML risks, 
they might become identified as facilitating ML/TF, which would have a negative 
impact for their business sectors and the Virgin Islands financial services industry 
generally. 
 AML/CFT failures within the FI, DNFBP and NPO sectors could lead to the Virgin 
Islands being viewed as a safe haven for money launderers and terrorist 
financiers, leading to a loss of confidence in trading with the Territory and 
harming its financial services and tourism sectors. 
 AML/CFT failures could lead to international sanctions and/or advisories, 
restricting the Virgin Islands’ ability to access international finance and its 
membership or leadership of international organisations.   
 AML/CFT failures could also restrict correspondent banking relationships, 
harming the Virgin Islands economy and driving business transactions 
underground, which would increase ML/TF risk further and impede international 
cooperation (tracing of business activities and funds). 
 Any reduction in financial services as a result of reputational damage could harm 
government revenue, affecting the Territory’s ability to fund infrastructure, social 
services, health and education. 
 
 
 
93 
 
14.21 Any inability to cooperate by the Virgin Islands could lead to the following negative 
effects: 
 A lack of timely responses to information request and other international 
cooperation by CAs could cause the Virgin Islands to be labelled as non-
cooperative or non-compliant, which in turn could lead to a negative listing, 
resulting in loss of business and reduced Government revenue. 
 Any poor handling of extradition and MLA requests due to a lack of staff 
knowledge or training or to weak cooperation between CAs could delay 
responses or even result in failure to execute the requests. 
 Any inconsistency in gathering BO information and verifying CDD/ECDD 
information by FIs and DNFBPs could hamper the effective processing of MLA 
requests which seek BO information.  
 Any failure by FIs to collect and maintain BO information on clients could impede 
domestic and international cooperation by preventing LEAs from tracing and 
apprehending people involved in ML/TF activities; and could impede LEAs’ 
ability freeze and confiscate the proceeds of crime. 
 Any failure by the FIA to assist overseas requests could make foreign authorities 
unable to pursue and prosecute criminals. 
 Inefficiencies within the RVIPF, especially as regards coordination between its 
own sections, could lead the RVIPF to concentrate only on predicate offences, 
resulting in increased ML activity in the Territory. 
 Lack of proper cooperation and coordination between agencies, primarily the 
HMC, ID and RVIPF (for border protection, crime detection and investigation) 
and the ODDP (for prosecution), could hinder law enforcement. 
14.22 Any inadequate and ineffective supervision and monitoring could result in the 
following inefficiencies: 
 If it proved unable to improve its supervision of NPOs, the FIA could not help 
protect the Virgin Islands from undesirable NPOs and, potentially, TF activity. 
 If the FIA did not increase staff numbers to supervise and monitor the DNFBP, 
HVG and NPO sectors more effectively, this could increase the ML/TF risk for 
the Territory, particularly in relation to NPOs. 
 If it did not increase staff numbers for supervision and inspections, the FSC might 
be unable to safeguard against the occurrence of ML/TF activities. 
 If detection of undeclared inbound and outbound cash did not improve, it could 
become easier for illegal proceeds to enter and leave the Territory and potentially 
find a way into the Territory’s banking system, facilitating ML/TF. 
 
 
94 
 
14.23 Increase in criminal activity  
 If laws relating to illegal gambling and other criminal behaviour associated with 
drug trafficking and ML were not enforced, this could lead to an increase in 
physical violence in the community.  
 If inadequate investigations into predicate offences and ML and shortcomings in 
handling extradition and MLA matters were not addressed, criminals might 
escape prosecution, retain their illegal proceeds and remain free to commit other 
crimes within and outside the BVI. 
 If the FIA was not able to speed up its analysis and internal investigation of 
SARs/STRs, this could leave the RVIPF with too little time to carry out a 
successful investigation leading to prosecution. 
 Any inadequate compliance with AML/CFT obligations by FIs and DNFBPs could 
lead to money launderers and terrorist financiers effectively being permitted to 
use Virgin Islands FIs without being detected and result in increased cross-
border criminality. 
 If the capacity to patrol the Territory’s borders were not improved, there could be 
smuggling of goods, narcotics and other contraband into and out of the Territory. 
 If LEAs, particularly the RVIPF, did not apply and distribute resources based on 
risk, sufficient resources might not go to high-risk areas such as border security, 
resulting in increased drug trafficking, ML and other criminal activity. 
 Any failure to investigate ML/TF activities that have a cross-border reach might 
result in criminals escaping prosecution and having unfettered access to the 
proceeds of their crimes.   
14.24 Low levels of ML/TF prosecutions and convictions  
 If the FIA could not analyse SARs/STRs and send intelligence to local and 
international law enforcement agencies in a more timely manner, low levels of 
ML/TF prosecutions and convictions might lead to low levels of confiscations and 
forfeiture so that criminals were not deprived of their ill-gotten gains.  
 If the courts did not receive resources to speed up their processes and improve 
AML/CFT training for court officers, the number of successful prosecutions for 
matters involving ML/TF might fall. 
14.25 Poor record keeping and analysis of data could contribute to the following 
failures: 
 Any deficiencies in record keeping by FIs and DNFBPs could result in an inability 
to reconstruct transactions for ML/TF or other financial crime investigations.   
 Poor records could also lead to failings in domestic and international cooperation 
where information for investigations and prosecutions was not available. 
 
95 
 
 Unless they are able to carry out strategic analysis of data, the FIs could not 
identify trends in ML activity, address specific risks identified, and allocate 
resources appropriately. 
 If LEAs and CAs were not able to provide relevant statistical data, any analysis 
of the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime could be difficult, leading to 
unfavourable compliance assessments for the Territory and pressure from the 
international community. 
14.26 Corruption would have the following effects if left unchecked: 
 Any high profile corruption cases involving HMC and RVIPF officers could affect 
the reputation of these agencies and the Territory as a whole. 
 If LEAs remained unable to identify and investigate corruption, corrupt officers 
might be able to retain any proceeds of crime from their corrupt practices, and 
LEA’s work would be stifled and/or compromised. 
14.27 Poor risk mitigation has the following consequences: 
 Particularly at the subscription stage, any weak application of client verification 
and CDD/ECDD measures by FIs, including TCSPs and banking institutions, 
could enable ML/TF to occur undetected. 
 Any failure to report SARs/STRs could mask the scale of FIs’ ML/TF risks, 
particularly TCSPs’ business relationships, and could prevent the FIA from being 
more proactive in investigating ML/TF and other financial crimes. 
 Any inconsistency in gathering BO information and verifying CDD/ECDD 
information by FIs, particularly TCSPs, could make it difficult for them to 
understand their clients’ activities and the potential or actual ML/TF risks. 
 If it did not prove possible to register all existing NPOs and for the FIA to 
supervise them properly, this could leave significant gaps in CDD and record 
keeping, resulting in the poor filing of SARs/STRs and hindering investigation of 
TF.

15. Conclusion 
15.1 The same factors that make the Virgin Islands an attractive place for legitimate 
financial activity – its political stability, advanced professional services sector, and 
widely understood language and legal system – also make it an attractive place 
through which to launder the proceeds of crime. In response to this the Virgin Islands 
has developed its AML/CFT regime over a number of years. 
15.2 The NRA exercise has taken a hybrid approach to assessing the regime, identifying 
institutional areas for improvement alongside the risks associated with various 
industry sectors. 
15.3 There is considerable opportunity to improve AML/CFT effectiveness in the BVI, 
including in the agencies critical to any successful mutual evaluation. Financial 
services supervisors have good systems which need strengthening. Supervision of 
the DNFBP, NPO and HVG sectors requires enhancement, not least in inspection. 
Following the NRA, CAs have already taken the opportunity to carry out 
improvements identified, some but not all of which are reflected in the Report. 
15.4 The Government is recommended to ensure that all areas for improvement 
identified in this Report are addressed without delay. A new AML/CFT 
Implementation Unit within the Ministry of Finance, overseen by the Deputy 
Financial Secretary, could coordinate this and have day-to-day oversight of 
implementation. This would work very closely with all agencies on developing timely 
action plans, and would submit a periodic report to Cabinet advising on each 
agency’s progress. The Government could undertake an overall assessment of 
improvements and next steps.
