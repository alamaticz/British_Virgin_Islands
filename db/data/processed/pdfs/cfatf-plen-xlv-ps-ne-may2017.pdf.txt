CFATF - Public Statement  
 
Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, May 31st, 2017 
 
 
The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) is an organisation comprised of twenty-five 
jurisdictions of the Caribbean Basin Region, which have agreed to implement the international 
standards for Anti-money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), the 
Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF Recommendations) in order to protect the 
international financial system from money laundering and financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risks 
and to encourage greater compliance with the AML/CFT standards, the CFATF identified 
jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies and works with them to address those deficiencies that 
pose a risk to the international financial system. 
 
 
 
Jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that has made significant progress in 
addressing its deficiencies.  
 
 
Haiti 
 
The CFATF acknowledges the significant progress made by Haiti in improving its AML/CFT 
regime since the last plenary held in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands in November 2016 
and notes that Haiti has substantially improved its Core and Key Recommendations and its legal 
and regulatory framework to meet its commitments in its agreed Action Plan regarding the 
strategic deficiencies that the CFATF had identified. 
As at 31st of May 2017, Haiti reported back to the CFATF plenary held in Trinidad and Tobago 
on their progress in respect of its Action Plan and demonstrated significant legislative and non-
legislative progress that includes the enactment and bringing into force of amendments to the 
2013 law sanctioning money laundering and terrorist financing and the organic law of UCREF; 
the issuance of the UCREF guidelines and the conducting of training and sensitization for the 
relevant reporting entities in relation to those guidelines.  
Haiti is encouraged to continue the reform process and demonstrate further progress by the 
November 2017 Plenary for the outstanding deficiencies. 
Haiti and the CFATF should continue to work together to ensure that its Action Plan is fully 
implemented.

Jurisdiction no longer subject to the CFATF-ICRG review process.  
 
 
Suriname 
 
Suriname was placed in the CFATF’s ICRG process in 2012 and was publicly listed by the 
CFATF. Since the adoption of its action plan, Suriname has established the legal and regulatory 
framework to meet its commitments in its agreed Action Plan regarding the strategic deficiencies 
that the CFATF had identified.  
Having made significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime and adequately addressing 
the key AML/CFT deficiencies identified, the CFATF Plenary of May 2017 agreed that 
Suriname be removed from the CFATF ICRG process and therefore Suriname is no longer 
subject to monitoring by CFATF ICRG.

The May 2017 Plenary in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, recognised the following jurisdiction 
that has made significant progress in addressing the deficiencies identified during the Third round 
of Mutual Evaluations conducted by the CFATF and that have successfully exited the follow-up 
process. 
 
 
Suriname 
 
 
 
The CFATF XLV Plenary recognised that Suriname had made significant progress in addressing 
the deficiencies identified in their 2009 Mutual Evaluation Report and therefore could exit the 
follow-up process. 
Suriname’s 11th Follow-Up Report, which was presented at the May 2017 Plenary contains a 
detailed description and analysis of the actions taken by Suriname to rectify the deficiencies 
identified in respect of the Core and Key Recommendations rated PC or NC, as well as a 
summary of progress in other Recommendations, in the 2009 Mutual Evaluation Report. 
Suriname, through legislative and administrative actions, has taken the necessary steps to close 
all the major gaps in its AML/CFT infrastructure. Therefore the CFATF encourages Suriname 
to continue their progress and ensuring that they are fully prepared for their 4th Round Mutual 
Evaluation.
