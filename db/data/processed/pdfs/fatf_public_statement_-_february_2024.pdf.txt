FATF PUBLIC STATEMENTS – FEBRUARY 2024 
 
The Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) has issued its latest public statements identifying 
jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter financing of 
terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes: 
 
1. High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action – 23 February 2024; and 
2. Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring – 23 February 2024.  
 
High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action  
 
High-risk jurisdictions have significant strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT/CPF regimes.  For 
all countries identified as high-risk, the FATF calls on all members and urges all jurisdictions to 
apply enhanced due diligence and, in the most serious cases, to apply counter-measures to 
protect the international financial system from the ML, TF and PF risks emanating from the 
country. 
 
A. High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call to Apply Countermeasures  
 
DPRK - the FATF remains concerned by the DPRK’s failure to address the significant deficiencies 
in its AML/CFT and has serious concerns with the threat posed by the DPRK to the integrity of the 
international financial system.  Jurisdictions are urged to advise their financial institutions to give 
special attention to business relationships and transactions with the DPRK, including DPRK 
companies, financial institutions, and those acting on their behalf.  
 
Jurisdictions are also urged to apply effective counter-measures and targeted financial sanctions 
in accordance with applicable United Nations Security Council Resolutions, to protect financial 
sectors from ML/TF/PF risks emanating from the DPRK.  
 
Jurisdictions should take necessary measures to close existing branches, subsidiaries and 
representative offices of DPRK banks within their territories and terminate correspondent 
relationships with DPRK banks, where required by relevant UNSC resolutions. 
 
Iran – The FATF remains concerned with the TF risk emanating from Iran and the threat this poses 
to the international financial system given Iran’s failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist 
Financing Conventions in line with FATF Standards.   As such, the FATF has fully lifted its 
suspension of counter-measures and calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply 
effective counter-measures, in line with Recommendation 19.   
 
B. High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call to Apply ECDD Measures   
 
Myanmar remains on the FATF’s list of countries subject to a call for action based on its slow 
progress in completing its action plan to address deficiencies identified in its Mutual Evaluation 
Report.  As such, the FATF has called on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply enhanced 
due diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from business relations and transactions 
with Myanmar.  However, when applying enhanced due diligence measures, countries should 
ensure that the flows of funds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and 
remittances are not disrupted.

Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring 
There are currently 26 countries under and subject to increased monitoring by the FATF, 
otherwise referred to as a ‘grey list.’ These jurisdictions are actively working with the FATF to 
address strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, 
and proliferation financing. When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it 
means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within 
agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring.  
 
There is no requirement to apply enhanced due diligence measures to these jurisdictions.  The 
FATF calls for the application of a risk-based approach when dealing with these countries and 
does not envisage de-risking, or cutting-off entire classes of customers.  The FATF encourages its 
members and all jurisdictions to take into account the information presented in the updated 
statements provided in the links below when carrying out their risk analysis.  
 
Since the February 2024 review, the FATF has listed Kenya and Namibia.  Statements issued in 
relation to Cameroon, Haiti, Syria, Vietnam and Yemen are also included but may not necessarily 
reflect the most recent status of these jurisdictions’ AML/CFT regime as these countries chose to 
defer reporting.

in improving their AML/CFT regime.  
 
The FATF’s full public statement on each of the countries under increased monitoring can be 
found here. 
 
The British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“FSC”) wishes to advise the general 
public, including all persons who are required to comply with the requirements of the Anti-
Money Laundering Regulations, 2008 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 
Code of Practice, 2008, to note the concerns expressed by the FATF with respect to the named 
jurisdictions and consider the associated money laundering and/or terrorist financing risks.   
 
The FSC encourages all to apply appropriate or enhanced customer due diligence measures when 
dealing with customers or handling transactions connected with any of the jurisdictions that the 
FATF’s public statements have identified.
