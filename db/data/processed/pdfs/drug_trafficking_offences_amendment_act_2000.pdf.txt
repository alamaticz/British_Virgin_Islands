This section applies where the 
whether defendant  
Court has made a determination (referred to 
in

(2) 
If the prosecutor has evidence 
 
 
(a) 
which 
was 
not 
considered 
by 
the 
Court in making the 
original determination, 
but

which the prosecutor 
believes would have 
led 
the 
Court 
to 
determine 
that 
the 
defendant

trafficking if it had 
been considered by 
the Court, 
 
he may apply to the Court for it to consider 
that evidence. 
 
(3) 
If, having considered the

account any payment or other reward 
received by the defendant on or after the 
date of the original determination, but only if 
the prosecutor shows that it was received by

trafficking carried on by the defendant or 
another on or before that date. 
 
(6)

Revision of  
 
8E. 
(1) 
This section applies where the 
assessment of  
Court has made a determination (referred to 
in 
proceeds of drug 
this section as “the current determination”) 
trafficking. 
 
under section 5 (1) (b) of the amount to be 
recovered in a particular case by virtue of 
that section. 
 
(2) 
Where the prosecutor is of 
the opinion that the real value of the 
defendant’s proceeds of drug trafficking was 
greater than their assessed value, the 
prosecutor may apply to the Court for the 
evidence on which the prosecutor has 
formed his opinion to be considered by the 
Court. 
 
(3) 
In subsection (2), 
 
“assessed value” means the value of the  
defendant’s 
proceeds 
of 
drug 
trafficking as assessed by the Court 
under section 8 (1); and 
 
“real value” means the value of the 
defendant’s 
proceeds 
of 
drug 
trafficking which took place 
 
(a) 
in 
the 
period 
by 
reference to which the 
current determination 
was made; or 
 
(b) 
in any earlier period. 
 
(4) 
If, having considered the 
evidence, the Court is satisfied that the real 
value of the defendant’s proceeds of drug 
trafficking is greater than their assessed value 
(whether because the real value was higher 
at the time of the current determination than 
was thought or because the value of the 
proceeds in question has subsequently 
increased), the Court shall make a fresh 
determination under section 5 (1) (b) of the 
amount to be recovered by virtue of that 
section. 
 
(5) 
Where 
the 
Court 
is 
proceeding under section 5, by virtue of this 
section, subsection (1) (b) of that section 
shall have effect as if the words “before 
sentencing or otherwise dealing with him in 
respect of the offence or, as the case may be, 
any of the offences concerned” were 
omitted. 
 
 
18 
 
(6) 
Any 
determination 
under 
section 5 (1) (b), by virtue of this section, 
shall be by reference to the amount that 
might be realised at the time when the 
determination is made. 
 
(7) 
For any determination under 
section 5 (1) (b), by virtue of this section, 
section 6 (5) shall not apply in relation to any 
of the defendant’s proceeds of drug 
trafficking taken into account in respect of 
the current determination. 
 
(8) 
In 
relation to any such 
determination 
 
(a) 
section 4 (7), 7 (4) (a) 
and 8 (2) shall have 
effect 
as 
if 
for 
“confiscation 
order” 
there were substituted 
“determination”; 
 
(b) 
section 8 (3) shall 
have effect as if for 
“confiscation order is 
made” 
there 
were 
substituted 
“determination 
is  
made”; and 
 
(c) 
section 4 (3) shall 
have effect as if for “a 
confiscation order is 
made 
against 
the 
defendant” there were 
substituted 
“of 
the 
determination”. 
 
(9) 
The Court may take into 
account any payment or other reward 
received by the defendant on or after the 
date of the current determination, but only if 
the prosecutor shows that it was received by 
the defendant in connection with drug 
trafficking carried on by the defendant or 
another on or before that date. 
 
(10) 
In considering any evidence 
under this section which relates to any 
payment or reward to which subsection (9) 
applies, the Court shall not make the 
assumptions which would otherwise be 
required by section 6. 
 
(11) 
If, as a result of making the 
fresh determination required by subsection 
(4), the amount to be recovered exceeds the 
 
 
19 
amount set by the current determination, the 
Court may substitute for the amount to be 
recovered under the confiscation order which 
was made by reference to the current 
determination such greater amount as it 
thinks just in all the circumstances of the 
case. 
 
(12) 
Where a confiscation order 
has been made in relation to the defendant by 
virtue of section 8A, this section shall not 
apply at any time while he is an absconder. 
 
(13) 
No 
application 
shall 
be 
entertained by the Court under this section if 
it is made after the end of the period of six 
years beginning with 
 
(a) 
the date on which the 
defendant 
was 
convicted; or 
 
(b) 
where he appeared to 
be 
sentenced 
in 
respect of more than 
one conviction, and 
those 
convictions 
were not all on the 
same date, the date of 
the latest of those 
convictions.”.
