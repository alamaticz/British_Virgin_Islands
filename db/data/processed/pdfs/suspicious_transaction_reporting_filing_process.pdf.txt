SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION
REPORTING FILING PROCESS
How can I make a filing with
the FIA? 
By hand delivery in a sealed envelope, stamped
"confidential" and addressed to the physical address
of the FIA. 
Electronically, by a secure reporting
system as advised by the FIA.
By facsimile to (284) 494 1435 in urgent cases.
What happens after the report is
filed with the FIA?
Once the suspicious transaction report is filed, the FIA will
send an acknowledgment letter to the reporting entity and
thereafter will commence the analysis of the suspicious
transaction report. 
What happens after the suspicious
transaction report is analysed?
After analysis of the report, the FIA will provide written feedback,
which will typically state one of the following:
An intelligence report has been sent to a local or foreign law
enforcement agency or Financial Intelligence Unit for
investigation.
The suspicious transaction report has been filed for intelligence
purposes and thus no further action is required at the material
time.
