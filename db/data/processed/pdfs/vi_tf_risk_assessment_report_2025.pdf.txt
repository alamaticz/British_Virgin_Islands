VIRGIN ISLANDS TERRORIST FINANCING RISK ASSESSMENT 2025 
Executive Summary 
 
The Virgin Islands (VI) first assessed its TF risk in 2020, at which time it considered its 
exposure to TF at both a national and sectoral level.  The findings of this initial TF Risk 
Assessment concluded that the TF risk to the VI was low in relation to domestic TF activity 
and medium low in relation to TF from international exposure. 
 
Since that time the VI has sought to enhance its understanding of its TF risk exposure and has 
chosen to update its TF Risk Assessment to reflect current threats and vulnerabilities identified 
that allow for the propagation of such risk. In order to so, a Working Group was formed 
comprising all relevant agencies from LEAs, the prosecution, the FIU, the supervisors, the 
competent authority for International Requests and the sanctions’ unit  who provided their 
expertise and experience as well as the data from their agencies in order for a detailed analysis 
to be conducted1. Additionally, information from counterparts and global typologies and open-
source material was also considered.  
 
A determination was made as to which countries posed the highest risk for terrorism and 
terrorist financing (Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries) and all possible links with these countries were 
examined for each regulated sector as well as for areas such as LPLAs, the use of cash and 
Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs). 
 
The risk of the use, collection and movement of funds for the purposes of TF in the VI was 
assessed. The risk of the use of terrorist funds and the collection of terrorist funds was found 
to be Low. The risk of the movement of terrorist funds through the VI (directly or indirectly) 
was found to be Medium-High. 
 
In order to assess the risk of movement in a more detailed manner, four typologies were 
identified by the WG and were assessed as to the risk that they could be misused for the 
purposes of TF. 
 
1 A detailed breakdown of data reviewed is contained in the ‘data source’ list. 
2 | P a g e  
 
 
The highest risk typology by which the movement of terrorist funds could occur in the VI was 
VI legal entities being abused for TF purposes (typology 1), this was found to be of Medium-
High risk. This was followed by the use of the VI entities as a conduit for the transit of funds 
that are intended to be used for terrorism purposes abroad, with funds being sent via a VI entity 
(typology 2), the highest risk entities by which this may occur are VASPs (MH), whereas the 
risk of misuse via banks and MSBs was found to be lower (L and ML), however, given the risk 
posed by VASPs this was given greater weighting, providing an overall risk rating of MH for 
this typology.  
 
The remaining two typologies were found to be lower risk. The risk of VI service providers 
(Financial Institutions (FIs) and Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions 
(DNFBPs)), knowingly or unknowingly facilitating the movement of funds for terrorism 
purposes, but without the funds actually entering or moving through the jurisdiction (typology 
3), was assessed as Medium-Low. The risk of the VI facilitating the movement through or from 
the VI of cash or precious metals and stones (PMS), or dual use goods as relevant to TF, was 
found to be Low. 
 
Threats, vulnerabilities and controls were considered as well as materiality. The sectors or areas 
most vulnerable to TF were found to be Legal Persons, Trust and Corporate Service Providers 
(TCSPs) and VASPs. 
 
Finally, recommendations were made to mitigate the risks posed including training and 
outreach on this risk assessment to the public and private sectors respectively, the continued 
enhancement of additional resources for the RVIPF, training on the misuse of legal persons 
and ensuring that law enforcement has access to adequate and accurate beneficial ownership 
information as well as resources in relation to matters concerning the tracing and recovery of 
virtual assets.

Introduction 
 
The VI is committed to playing its role in the global fight against TF.  Terrorists regularly adapt 
how and where they raise and move funds and other assets to circumvent safeguards that 
jurisdictions have put in place to detect and disrupt this activity. Identifying, assessing and 
understanding TF risk is an essential part of dismantling and disrupting terrorist networks2. 
 
The VI undertook its last Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment (TFRA) in 2020. In 2023, the 
National AML/CFT Coordinating Council (NAMLCC) issued a statement re-affirming its 
commitment to strengthening the Territory’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Countering the 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Countering Proliferation Financing (CPF) regime, in which it 
committed to updating the VI’s National AML/CFT Policy, strategy and current RAs at least 
every two years, to take into account all relevant changes to the threats and vulnerabilities that 
impact the Territory’s risk of Money Laundering (ML), TF and Proliferation Financing (PF) 
and to ensure ongoing compliance with international standards. It was therefore determined 
that the TFRA of 2020 was to be updated. 
 
This Risk Assessment enhances the previous findings, considers the latest data and incorporates 
the findings of separate RAs conducted in 2024, in relation to LPLAs in so far as it relates to 
TF risk, as well as the TFRA of NPOs. It also takes into account the findings and recommended 
actions identified in the Territory’s 2024 Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), as well as the 
remediation undertaken since that time. The WG took into account all relevant available data 
in the consideration of the TF risk, the mitigation of that risk and the next steps to be taken. 
 
As an International Financial Centre (IFC), the understanding of TF risk in the VI is 
fundamental, given the global nature and complexity of the products and services offered that 
could increase the jurisdiction’s exposure to potential TF. This includes where cross border 
and complex structures and activities affect the ability of the Financial Investigation Agency - 
Analysis and Investigation Unit (FIA-AIU) and other LEAs to identify TF cases. It is also 
 
2 FATF TFRA Guidance, paragraph 1. 
7 | P a g e  
 
important to ensure that FIs3 and DNFBPs4 have a robust understanding of risk to assist with 
the number and quality of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed in relation to TF. 
 
The main objective of the RA was to assess the jurisdiction’s  risk exposure to TF in order to  
(1) deepen the understanding of TF risk by LEAs, other public sector agencies and the private 
sector (2) deepen the understanding of the TF risks posed by the FI and DNFBP sectors, (3) 
deepen the understanding of the TF risks posed by the misuse of LPLAs and NPOs, and the 
use of cash in the jurisdiction and (4) implement/enhance appropriate mitigating measures.  
1.1 The Working Group 
The WG was composed of members from the following agencies: RVIPF5 (Financial Crime 
Unit (FCU) and Intelligence Unit (IU)), Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) (International 
Cooperation Team (ICT) and National Coordination Team), Financial Investigation Agency – 
Analysis and Investigation Unit (FIA-AIU), The FIA-Supervision and Enforcement Unit (FIA 
SEU), Financial Services Commission (FSC), Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions 
(ODPP), Department of Immigration (DOI), His Majesty’s Customs (HMC), Sanctions 
Coordinator, and the Governor’s Office (GO). The WG was established to ensure a wide range 
of experience and expertise from agencies involved in the Territory’s CFT measures.  Members 
were tasked with collecting and analysing data, reviewing findings and considering the 
appropriateness of applied risk ratings. 
1.2 The Regulated Sectors 
The following sectors were reviewed under the umbrella of FIs: Banking, MSBs, Insurance, 
Investment Business (IB), Financing, Insolvency Services6, VASPs and Virtual Assets (VAs), 
TCSPs (these were also assessed separately by the LPLAs WG). 
 
The following sectors were reviewed under the umbrella of DNFBPs: Accountants, Lawyers 
and Notaries, Real Estate Agents, Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones (DPMS) and High-
Value Goods Dealers (HVGDs). 
 
3 FIs include financial institutions, as defined by FATF and as supervised in the VI. 
4 DNFBPs include Designated Non-Financial Business and Professions, as defined by FATF and as supervised 
in the VI. 
5 The sole LEA responsible for the investigation of terrorist and TF related activities, development and 
implementation of the Territory’s Counter-Terrorism strategy. 
6 Whilst this is not a FI for FATF purposes it is regulated as such in the VI. 
8 | P a g e  
 
1.3 The Tier 1 and Tier 2 Countries 
The WG reviewed relevant credible sources such as the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2024, 
issued by the Institute for Economics and Peace, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list 
of countries under increased monitoring7, the FATF list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a 
Call for Action, the Corruption Perception Index as well as recent advisories 8 and also 
considered whether there were any other countries vulnerable to TF with links to the VI. 
Consequently, two Tiers of countries were identified. Tier 1 countries represent those countries 
that have a high risk of terrorism or TF activities based on their appearance on the noted lists 
or indexes.  Tier 2 countries represent those countries that have identified TF risk, but the risk 
is considered less than that of the Tier 1 countries. These two Tiers were used in the assessment 
of links to countries of higher risk for TF. 
 
The list of Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries as determined by the Terrorist Financing Risk 
Assessment Working Group was also used by the Legal Persons and Legal Arrangements Risk 
Assessment Working Group when assessing TF risk to ensure consistency. 
 
TIER 1 – 12 Countries 
Burkina Faso, Mali, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Nigeria, Myanmar, Niger, Yemen, 
Iran, Lebanon. 
TIER 2 - 19 Countries 
Iraq, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Mozambique, Colombia, Chile, 
Kenya, Philippines, Egypt, Chad, Turkey, Haiti, Algeria, UAE, Saudia Arabia, Qatar, Palestine, 
Israel. 
1.4 The Review Period 
The period under review was 2020 to 2023. This was to ensure that there was continuity from 
the previous RA which considered data between 2015 and 2019, and to enable the most recent 
available data to be taken into account (namely year end 2023). As the risk assessment 
 
7 Consideration was also given to countries on the grey list which were not on the GTI in terms of their IO9, IO10, 
R5 and R6 ratings. 
8 E.g. FinCEN advisory of May 2024 
9 | P a g e  
 
progressed additional information from 2024 became available which was also included to 
ensure that the risk assessment provided the most up-to-date information available. 
1.5 The Methodology 
Data was collected and analysed from VI agencies (both members of the WG and outside), 
regulated entities and from other credible sources9. The data was analysed and threats relating 
to the movement, collection and use of funds were identified and rated. Based on the ratings 
the threat related to movement was focused on and four typologies identified were assessed, 
this included the analysis of financial flows involving jurisdictions at higher risk for terrorism 
or TF. The risk of the movement of cash and PMS for the purposes of TF was also considered. 
Next, vulnerabilities were considered, first in relation to each regulated sector and in relation 
to the risk of the misuse of LPLAs for TF, the risk of the misuse of NPOs for TF and the risk 
of the misuse of cash as well as at the national level. The materiality of the sectors and areas 
was also taken into account. Finally, the controls were analysed and applied to determine the 
residual TF risk.  
2. 
Threat Analysis 
The FATF defines a TF threat as a person or group of people with the potential to cause harm 
by raising, moving, storing or using funds and other assets (whether from legitimate or 
illegitimate sources) for terrorist purposes. TF threats may include domestic or international 
terrorist organisations and their facilitators, their funds, as well as past, present and future TF 
activities, and individuals and populations sympathetic to terrorist organisations.10 
 
In order to analyse whether identified TF threats related to the collection, movement, or use of 
funds, data was collected from all relevant agencies including law enforcement as well as 
international counterparts and the use of open-source information. Additionally, as outlined 
above, four typologies were identified in relation to the movement of funds and each of these 
was also assessed. The ratings used to assess the identified threats were Low (L), Medium-Low 
(ML), Medium-High (MH) or High (H). 
 
The four identified typologies utilised in this RA are: 
 
9 See data source sheet attached to methodology for full list. 
10 FATF TFRA Guidance, Paragraph 15 
10 | P a g e  
 
 
• Typology 1: abuse of VI legal entities for TF purposes.  
• Typology 2: Use of the VI legal entities as a conduit for the transit of funds that 
are intended to be used for terrorism purposes abroad, with funds being sent via 
a VI entity such as a bank, MSB or VASP.  
• Typology 3: Facilitation of the movement of funds for TF purposes by VI 
service providers (FIs or DNFBPs), whether knowingly or unknowingly, but 
without the funds entering or moving through the jurisdiction or VI entity – for 
example, VI lawyers providing services to clients that support foreign terrorism.  
• Typology 4: Facilitation of the movement through or from the VI of cash, 
Bearer Negotiated instruments (BNIs), PMS, or dual use goods as relevant to 
TF). 
 
Data was collected and analysed as it relates to SARs, investigations, prosecutions, potential 
sanctions breaches and incoming requests for MLA. The RVIPF IU confirmed that there was 
no other intelligence or information relating to terrorism or TF or related assets in its 
possession, therefore no terrorism or TF related occurred during the review period. 
Consequently, there were no terrorism or TF prosecutions or prosecutions and there were no 
prosecutions relating to any of the Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries during the review period.  
2.1 Terrorism 
The FIA-AIU received 2 ordinary SARs flagged for potential terrorism in 2020, but it was 
established these in fact had no link to terrorism. In 2021 one SAR was identified as a 
‘terrorism-related SAR’ but on further analysis was reclassified as a TF SAR and is dealt with 
below11. No ordinary SARs were received in 2022 or 2023 related to terrorism. Between 2020 
and 2023, three SARs involving VAs were identified as relating to terrorism,12 however, they 
were not assigned for analysis as two of the accounts held at virtual asset exchanges related to 
these VA SARs were closed and one account seemed to have been abandoned13.  Each of these 
matters related to BVIBCs providing VASP services.  
 
 
11 The matter was disseminated to a foreign FIU and closed. 
12 In relation to reports regarding VA SARS these were previously categorised as spontaneous disclosures, 
therefore for the purpose of this review only such SARs from 2022 onwards were reviewed. 
13 It should be noted that subsequently the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) was updated to outline the 
need for interim disclosures of such SARs within 5 days with followed up in-depth analysis. 
11 | P a g e  
 
Only one outgoing request was sent by the FIA-AIU in relation to potential terrorism links in 
the management of a BVIBC, which was sent in 2020, however, no response was received 
from the requested authority. Further analysis by the FIA-AIU did not reveal any link to 
terrorism in that matter. 
 
Between 2020 and 2023 the AGC received one incoming Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) 
request relating to terrorism, connected to a terrorist organisation. This request related to 
information sought from a VI company’s Registered Agent regarding the activities of a 
messenger service company registered in the VI. 14 There were no incoming or outgoing 
extradition requests in relation to terrorism. 
Demographics of the Local Population and Movement of Persons15 
 
Between 2021 and 2023, of the total 476886 ‘tourist’ classifications, 3,041 ‘tourists’ whose 
nationalities were of a Tier 2 countries (most commonly Haiti), and 90 ‘tourists’ with 
nationalities of Tier 1 countries (most commonly Nigeria), entered the VI.    
Between 2021 and 2023, 2,738 nationals from Tier 2 countries were recorded as residing in the 
VI, the majority being from the Philippines.  In relation to Tier 1 countries, 178 residents were 
identified. The most common country of citizenship for residents from Tier 1 countries was 
Nigeria (60%). There have been no reports, intelligence or other information to suggest any 
link to terrorism by these groups of persons. 
Labour Force Statistics 2020-2023 
The number of persons within the VI labour force originating from Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries 
for the years 2020-2023 is outlined in the table below.

14 The information was not maintained in the VI as the principal place of business was another jurisdiction. 
However, the Registered Agent provided the contact information and the location of the business records, which 
were passed on to the Requesting State. 
15 Note this does not include business owners.  
12 | P a g e  
 
 
The most common Tier 1 countries identified as part of the VI’s labour force were Nigeria and 
Lebanon, while the Philippines was identified as the most common Tier 2 country.  
 
In relation to new work permit holders and newly residing persons, between 2020 and 2023, 
814 persons were registered from Tier 2 countries which consisted of new work permit holders, 
returning work permit holders, new residing persons and government employees for this period. 
In relation to Tier 1 countries, there were a total of 40 permits of all types as well as residencies 
registered by DOI. 
 
There has not been any incoming or outgoing information exchange between DOI and 
counterparts in high-risk jurisdictions, nor any other jurisdiction relating to TF or terrorism. To 
date, the DOI has not received and does not have any intelligence from any of the high-risk 
jurisdictions regarding any potential linkages to terrorism, TF nor terrorist organisations 
relating to residents, work permit holders or visitors. 
 
DOI has seen an annual increase in the number of persons detained in the VI from Haiti and 
Cameroon directly related to migrant smuggling16. These cases, however, are not related to 
terrorism or TF.  The DOI has identified and intercepted several nationals from two Tier 2 
countries17, who intended to migrate illegally to the United States (US) once gaining entry to 
the VI legally. Within the migrants smuggled, there have not been any linkages to terrorism or 
TF.18   
 
 
16 For example, in October 2021, DOI facilitated interviews with Haitian migrants in custody with investigators 
from country A regarding a migrant smuggling case that was initiated in country A as the confirmed port of 
embarkation. However, the country A authorities were unable to obtain sufficient documentation for extradition 
prior to the illegal migrants’ repatriation to their home country. The case was not found to be related to terrorism 
or terrorist financing. 
17 Intelligence from regional agencies suggests that these nationalities traverse various countries seeking means 
to smuggle to the US 
18 DOI remains cognizant of the risks posed where there are no forms of identification and the potential use of 
criminal organisations as well as the risk of exploitation of the refugee and asylum processes, although VI does 
not have law provisions to grant the Haitians and Cameroonians, in attempt to get to the US, apply for asylum 
upon illegal entry. 
13 | P a g e  
 
Furthermore, HMC noted the risk of vessels entering the Territory, potentially without the 
requisite documentation for all persons. A 2022 example indicated that HMC discovered a 
vessel that had arrived without proper clearance and with persons who were subject to Red 
Notices, they were later detained.19 Thus far, no such matters have been TF or terrorism related. 
 
The RVIPF and the FIA-AIU have not received any intelligence in relation to Foreign Terrorist 
Fighters, home grown terrorists (residents or work permit holders) or any incidents of terrorism 
in the VI. 
 
This analysis supports the conclusion that the threat of terrorism and the threat of the collection 
or use of funds for the purposes of terrorism in the VI is low, however the emerging threat of 
migrant smuggling remains under observation, including any potential links to terrorism or TF, 
which has thus far not been the case. 
2.2 Terrorist Financing 
 
Between 2020 and 2023, 100 TF related SARs were received, 88 of which related to VAs.  Of 
the remaining 12, one ordinary SAR (received in 2023) resulted in disclosure to the FCU in 
2024. A total of 12 of the 88 VA SARS were disseminated to foreign jurisdictions.  11 of those 
12 SARs were also disseminated to the FCU.20. 
 
Additionally, the FIA-AIU’s outgoing international requests relating to TF increased to 29 in 
2023, from 3 in 2022, and 0 in 2021 and 2020.  
 
Furthermore, 2 international requests were received by the FIA-AIU regarding TF. One of these 
requests related to British Virgin Islands Business Company (BVIBC), which was the subject 
of the request and one related to a BVIBC operating as a VASP and the misuse of 
cryptocurrency. One request related to the misuse of a VASP to transact in cryptocurrency with 
an address labelled “The Forgotten Ones-Pro-Isis Telegram”.21 Another request related to 
 
19 https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/charter-boat-crew-returns-home-after-bvi-detention. 
20This related to a SAR filed regarding an alleged association between a BVIBC and a terrorist group. Information 
was received from various relevant jurisdictions. The relevant intelligence was disseminated to relevant foreign 
jurisdictions and relevant domestic Authorities.  
21 (2022) 
14 | P a g e  
 
potential funding to a Tier 1 country via a bank account held by a BVIBC in a foreign 
jurisdiction.22  
 
During this period, 705 SARs related to identified high-risk jurisdictions were received. A total 
of 660 of which were crypto related. Thirteen disseminations were made to relevant 
jurisdictions and the FCU relating to high-risk jurisdictions, 4 of which related to TF (and 6 of 
which 13 were crypto related). The disseminations were made to the relevant jurisdictions and 
the FCU. In addition, 87 international requests were received regarding high-risk jurisdictions. 
None of which, other than those two classified as TF above, were found to be TF related. 
 
The total VA SARs received between 2022 and 2023 was 10,161.  During the same time period 
a total of 20 disseminations were made to the relevant jurisdictions and the FCU.23 Of these, 9 
(45%) related to TF. 24  There were also 17 incoming international requests relating to 
cryptocurrencies in 2022 and 34 in 2023, 2 of which related to TF. Domestic requests related 
to VAs were 1 in 2020, 1 in 2021, 8 in 2022 and 10 in 2023. This category of SAR significantly 
exceeds any other category and signals a potentially elevated threat of the misuse of VASPs 
generally, as well as for the movement of funds for potential TF purposes.  
 
For VA SARs received between 2022 and 2023, 19 related to TF high-risk jurisdictions, 1 
related to terrorism. The countries identified were all Tier 2 countries. Suspicion of fraud was 
the largest category with 105 VA SARs recorded. The general suspicion of ML was the second 
largest category with 87. For ordinary SARs received between 2020 to 2023, 1 related to TF 
and 1 related to terrorism. The largest number of SARs related to high-risk jurisdictions was in 
relation to a Tier 2 country, with a total of 17. The second largest number was 16 relating to 
another Tier 2 country. Lack of customer due diligence (CDD) was the most common issued 
identified (25 SARs)25. Fraud and ML were each identified in 8 SARs.  
 
 
22 (2022) 
23 Prior to 2022 virtual asset reports were considered information disclosures rather than SARs 
24 In addition to TF, other suspicions included Child Sexual Abuse Material, fraud, embezzlement, cybercrime, 
theft. 
25 It is noted that after 2022, the method of categorising offences changed, and lack of CDD was excluded as an 
‘offence’.

In 2022, 3 disseminations were received by the FCU from the FIA-AIU in relation to TF and 
3 investigations were commenced. In 2023, 8 disseminations were received in relation to TF 
and 8 investigations were commenced.26 The RVIPF-FCU provided 14 cases studies27 in 
relation to TF investigations commenced.  All matters relate to BVIBCs. These are all ongoing 
investigations.  
 
13 of the investigations relate to BVIBCs operating VASP platforms and the potential misuse 
of these platforms. The final matter relates to the use of a dissolved BVIBC’s bank account to 
send and receive funds. Therefore, all cases fall into typology 1, with the majority also falling 
into the more specific typology 2.  Both typology 1 and typology 2 were found to be Medium 
High Risk, for typology 2 this particularly related to the movement of VAs through VASPs.  
 
No disseminations were received by the FCU from the FIA-AIU regarding VAs in 2020 and 
2021. In 2022, three TF investigations commenced based on disseminations all of which 
involved BVIBCs offering virtual asset services.  In 2023, 10 disseminations were made to the 
FCU in relation to VAs.  A total of 8 of these disseminations were related to TF and 
investigations were commenced.28 
 
Since 202029 the RVIPF FCU has received a total of 14 disseminations relating to funds or 
virtual assets being moved for the purpose of financing terrorism. The disseminations received 
do not always identify the terrorist organisation involved, which may be unknown.30 None of 
the matters under current investigation relate to the collection or use of funds or virtual assets 
for the purpose of TF.  13 of the disseminations relate to BVIBCs acting as VASPs which may 
have facilitated the movement of funds via a platform and all 13 investigations relating to the 
misuse of VASPs for TF are under investigation by the FCU. One TF investigation opened in 
2024 following a dissemination from the FIA-AIU did not involve a VASP but involves a 
complex multi-jurisdictional investigation into the suspected use of a dissolved BVIBC’s bank 
 
26 As of August 2024, 2 disseminations had been received regarding TF and 2 investigations commenced.  
27 3 from 2022, 8 from 2023 and 3 from 2024. 
28 As of August 2024, 1 dissemination had been made to the FCU regarding virtual assets, which was not 
alleged to relate to TF. 
29 There were no disseminations received by the RVIPF from the FIA-AIU or any other source in relation to 
terrorism or terrorist financing in 2020 or 2021 and no investigations were commenced. In 2022 there were 6 
disseminations, 3 of which were TF, in 2023 there were 10 disseminations, 8 of which were TF. (In 2024 3 TF 
disseminations were received).

account to transfer money. These investigations are in the stage of evidence collection to 
establish whether there is sufficient evidence to submit to the ODPP for charge.  
Other than the FIU disseminations received by the FCU and described above, there have been 
no incoming international cooperation, MLA or LEA requests received by the FCU regarding 
TF, terrorism or high-risk terrorist countries for the period 2020 to 2023. 
 
Between 2020 and 2023, one incoming MLA request was received by AGC relating to 
purported TF connected to a terrorist organisation. However, the request did not comply with 
the legal threshold for providing MLA as there was no ongoing criminal investigation in the 
Requesting State and an insufficient nexus was provided in relation to the two VI companies 
into which the request was made.   
 
There were no incoming or outgoing extradition requests relating to TF. A total of 24 MLA 
requests were received from Tier 2 countries (the majority related to service of documents), 
(none from Tier 1 countries) during the reporting period, however none of these related to 
terrorism or TF.31 There were no outgoing requests to any Tier 1 or Tier 2 country. 
 
Between the period 2020-2024, the FIA-Supervision Enforcement Unit (SEU) documented one 
case where a lawyer provided litigation services to a company with alleged close ties to a 
terrorist organisation (the lawyer was not conducting relevant activities for the purposes of 
AML supervision) (Typology 3). This matter was disclosed to the FCU and to foreign FIUs by 
the FIA-AIU.     
 
RVIPF IU did not receive any requests from international counterparts where TF was the 
primary offence.32 A total of 120 Interpol requests were received in 2023, 65 of which were 
sent to the FIA-AIU. None of those requests were from Tier 1 or 2 countries, however over 
half were from the Baltic region. No data could be obtained for the years 2020-2022 due to 
technical issues with the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) system.  It 
is unknown by RVIPF Intelligence whether these requests were in relation to sanctions or if 
they were TF related, as the member country does not state the reason for the request. RVIPF 
Intelligence does not collect the figures for non-FIA-related requests 
 
31 13 related to the service of documents in civil matters, 3 did not show a nexus to the VI and the remaining 8 
related to other criminal offences relating to BVIBCs, and the information was provided 
32 Other offences are not noted. 
17 | P a g e  
 
 
 As part of the RA process, the RVIPF reached out to their most frequent counterparts directly 
and utilising the informal network of Arin Carib, no relevant information was identified 
concerning any known terrorism or TF threat to the VI. 
2.2.1 Targeted Financial Sanctions Breaches Relating to Terrorist Financing 
As demonstrated in the table below, there were a total of 39 SARs filed regarding breaches of 
Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS) relating to TF:

While TFS disseminations were made to the Governor’s Office between 2020 and 2024, in 
relation to non-TF sanctions’ breaches, no disseminations were made to the FCU relating to 
TF-TFS between 2020 and 2023 (nor to the Governor’s Office). However, in 2024, one 
dissemination was made in relation to TF-TFS sanctions (to the FCU and the GO) and an 
investigation commenced.  
 
There were no requests for designation during the review period and no licences requested or 
granted relating to persons designated under the TF sanctions regimes. The Governor’s Office 
was notified by a Competent Authority of the designation of a beneficial owner of 9 BVI 
Companies on another country’s Sanctions List. The said sanctioned individual was said to be 
potentially linked to a terrorist organisation. The 9 BVI companies associated with this 
designated person were not sanctioned by any UK or UN Sanctions Regimes. This information 
was further shared with several other jurisdictions.  
 
Since June 2023, the GO has received an increase in suspected/attempted sanctions breaches 
involving funds being transited through VI VASPs. During 2023, these related to the Russian 
sanctions regime. The movement of funds VAs through VASPs (typology 2) is therefore 
increasing in prevalence. 
 
18 | P a g e  
 
The data gathered above points to an elevated risk of the misuse of VASPs in the VI for 
moving funds for the purposes of financing terrorism and/or breaching TF-TFS. The figures 
demonstrate that the misuse of VI entities in the movement of funds or VAs is the highest risk 
(and that collection and use of such funds are low risk) and that this particularly relates to the 
misuse of VASPs and the movement of VAs. 
2.2.2 The Misuse of British Virgin Islands’ Business Companies for Terrorist Financing 
Between 2020 and March 2024, the FIA received 13 TF SARs relating to BVIBCs. All the TF 
SARs that involved a legal person or arrangement related to a BVIBC (and not another type 
of legal person or arrangement). The FIA disseminated 13 disclosures relating to TF connected 
to BVIBCs to the FCU.  Moreover, 12 of the 13 SARs disseminated were filed by a BVIBC 
that was carrying out activities involving VAs. Only one SAR disclosed suspicion of a 
BVIBC’s involvement in TF.  
 
Between 2020 and 2024, the RVIPF opened 14 investigations relating to TF involving legal 
persons. One of the TF investigations related to a suspected sanctions breach with a TF 
element. Each investigation related to BVIBCs (3 in 2022, 8 in 2023 and 3 in 2024). There 
were no investigations into foreign companies, other types of legal persons or trusts.  
 
MLA figures for requests received from third countries between 2020 and 2024, show one 
incoming request involving a BVIBC relating to terrorism and one relating to TF. There were 
no other requests relating to any other types of LPLAs in relation to TF.   
  
The threat rating for BVIBCs33 in the LPLA RA was Medium-High, the threat rating for other 
LPLAs was Low. As BVIBCs are by far the largest sub-set of all LPLAs, and 99% of these 
are BVIBCs limited by shares, this is the rating used for this RA. 
2.2.3 The Misuse of Cash for Terrorist Financing 
Whilst SARs filed in relation to cash deposits have increased (2020 – 15, 2021 – 41, 2022 – 
105, 2023 – 28) and SARs are received concerning unknown source of cash deposits, no 
analysis of such SARs has led to a TF suspicion. Furthermore, according to the RVIPF IU, 
 
33 BVIBCs are by far the largest sub-set of all legal persons and legal arrangements types in the VI. There are 5 
possible types of BVIBCs. BVIBCs limited by shares represent approximately 99% of all BVIBCs (paragraph 26, 
LPLA RA). 
19 | P a g e  
 
there is no intelligence on record to suggest any TF offences occurring using cash intensive 
businesses or via the movement of cash. 
 
The FCU has received no information passed through by intelligence, either from the FIA or 
any other source, relating to cash being moved through the territory relating to TF. The 
instances of cash misuse emanate primarily from the importation/possession of controlled 
drugs or failing to declare cash over $10,000 being discovered at the border. There is no 
evidence that any of these seizures involve Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries. 
  
The movement of cash throughout the VI has primarily been by way of cargo vessels and go-
fast vessels and has on occasion been used for drug transactions.34 There has been no link to 
TF in any of the interceptions conducted.  
 
In relation to cash intensive businesses such as car hire companies, launderettes, construction 
companies, local music industry, car washes, hair salons, restaurants/bars, maritime services, 
there is no intelligence to suggest any TF offences may be occurring.  
 
Informal Transfer Services Such as Hawala or Alternatives 
During the relevant period, the RVIPF FCU has not received any direct intelligence to support 
the existence of informal transfer services such as Hawala or any alternatives, and there was 
no intelligence, SARs or other information indicating any link between the use of Hawala or 
any other informal transfer service and the VI. Furthermore, the FSC policing the perimeter 
has not found any such system. 
 
The frequency and value of the movement of cash or BNIs in and out of the jurisdiction was 
considered, as well as whether any such movement had any links to terrorism or TF, or 
generally to higher-risk jurisdictions. Cash seizures by law enforcement were also considered 
in terms of their frequency and value, as well as any link to terrorism or TF or any high-risk 
jurisdiction. Intelligence gathered by the RVIPF IU on the misuse of cash (or BNIs), the 
 
34in 2020, two persons were arrested following a chase by officers from Customs, Immigration and the police 
force, with over $800,000.00 on a go- fast vessel,  they were later convicted of offences including possession of 
proceeds of criminal conduct and failing to declare money: Duo found with $805K in BVI waters found guilty! 
$$ forfeited to Crown (bvinews.com). The carrying of cash just below the $10,000 threshold, primarily to the 
Dominican Republic, was noted by HMC to have subsided in recent years. 
20 | P a g e  
 
frequency of such reports, the amounts, the level of concern and any links to terrorism, TF or 
high risk jurisdictions as well as information held by the FIA-AIU (SAR filings, international 
requests etc.) were considered and it was concluded that whilst the misuse of cash posed a 
threat, the threat in relation to the misuse of cash for TF purposes was low.   
2.2.4 The Movement of Goods and Precious Metals and Stones 
During the years 2020-2023, goods (mainly clothing, furniture, stationery, jewellery) were 
declared upon importation through the Customs Automated Processing System via a Trader 
Declaration and these declarations were analysed.  
 
Goods in the VI are primarily imported from the US mainland. There has also been an increase 
of importation of goods from China, but none from high-risk TF countries. There has never 
been an interception of goods destined for high-risk countries where such goods were being 
transited through the VI.  
 
In 2021, jewellery originating from a Tier 2 country was imported from the US to the VI seven 
times, via ferry terminals and carried by the passenger, each contained a stamped declaration 
form from US Customs35. Other goods, originating from a Tier 1 country were imported 
through the airport. HMC reviewed these matters and confirmed there was no link to TF. In 
relation to the movement of PMS, the route used appeared to be from Country A to Country 
B and onwards to Country C. There was no suspected link to TF  
 
Neither the RVIPF FCU nor the FIA-AIU had received any intelligence from any source 
relating to the movement of PMS for the purposes of TF. As such, the RVIPF FCU has 
conducted no investigations in relation to the movement of PMS.  In relation to the movement 
or smuggling of goods including cash, BNIs and PMS, the RVIPF IU received no information 
or intelligence relating to TF. Furthermore, there was no intelligence in relation to significant 
links to Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries, or to TF or terrorism. No vessels were registered to a legal 
owner in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 country or had any links to terrorism or TF. 
 
 
35 On one occasion it was ascertained that the passenger was enroute to another jurisdiction as there were no direct 
flights. 
21 | P a g e  
 
Therefore, in relation to the movement of goods and the movement of PMS there has been no 
suspicion of, or information in relation to, TF. 
2.2.5 The Misuse of Virgin Islands’ Non-Profit Organisations for Terrorist Financing36 
Between the period 2021-2023, based on data collected from the RVIPF, there were no 
intelligence-led investigations, criminal investigations or allegations in credible open sources 
related to TF involving VI NPOs or their representatives (including employees, volunteers or 
other individuals acting in an official capacity representing an NPO). The FIA-AIU indicated 
that during the period 2021-2023, there was no intelligence received in relation to VI NPOs 
or their representatives being involved in TF and there were no STRs/SARs received related 
to TF involving NPOs or their representatives (including employees, volunteers or other 
individuals acting in an official capacity representing an NPO). During the period of 2021 – 
2023, there were no NPO related case files (TF or otherwise) submitted to the ODPP and no 
TF prosecutions or convictions. 
 
The NPO TFRA (2024) found that the level of TF abuse is low for all categories of FATF 
NPOs. This is evidenced by the data collected from the relevant LEAs, with no reports of TF-
related SARs, intelligence investigations, prosecutions, convictions or SARs in relation to any 
NPOs or their representatives, within the period of 2021-2023.  The level of foreign TF threat 
is Medium-Low on account of a few FATF NPOs with affiliation, control structures and 
disbursements connected to Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions during the period of 2021-2023. 
The domestic terrorist threat is low in the VI based on intelligence from LEA with no records 
of known terrorist groups, organisations and/or terrorist fighters or self-radicalised terrorists 
operating in or targeting the VI.  
2.3  TF Open Source case studies – Legal Persons and Legal Arrangements 
In addition to the information in the possession of the VI agencies, other reliable sources were 
also researched to gather information about the misuse of the VI for the purposes of terrorism 
or TF. 
 
36 In accordance with FATF Recommendation 8, the VI undertook a domestic review of the entire NPO sector to 
identify the NPOs that fall within the scope of the FATF definition of a NPO, to assess the terrorist financing risks 
facing FATF NPOs, to identify the subset of NPOs which are most at risk for TF abuse and to determine the 
adequacy of the  laws, regulations, and other measures in place to mitigate those risks, this risk assessment was 
completed in 2024. 
 
22 | P a g e  
 
 
Eight cases were found during an open-source search relating to TF and VI entities. In terms 
of the type of VI entities utilised, BVIBCs featured most prominently.  
 
In one case, a  business within a tier 1 country with alleged ties to a convicted war criminal 
and supporter of a terrorist group37 used a VI-registered company38 as part of a broader 
financial network to facilitate illicit transactions. These examples highlight how VI companies 
can be exploited for illicit financial flows linked to terrorism. 
 
In another case, VI companies were seen to be used as fronts to move funds through the US 
financial system for the benefit of a State Sponsor of Terrorism39.  
 
Other cases identified potential direct and indirect links to terrorists and terrorist organisations 
worldwide. In these cases, VI companies were allegedly used as front companies for illicit 
funds movement, or as part of complex structures allegedly used to fund individuals linked to 
terrorist organisations.  
 
In another matter, highlighted in the LPLA RA, an individual resident in Country 1, a country 
known to support terrorism, operated several companies around the world in the real estate, 
food processing and diamond industries. The individual used the profit from his companies to 
purchase properties to be used by known terrorist organisations and to engage in trade-based 
money laundering.  The individual incorporated a BVIBC, which shared a name and was a 
subsidiary of a company in Country 1, as part of the worldwide corporate structure to facilitate 
the transfer of funds to the terrorist organisation. The individual became designated under a 
counter-terrorism TFS regime. 40  However, the individual’s name did not appear on the 
ownership records for the VI entity. This example shows how terrorist financiers and

designated persons seek to obscure the BO of legal persons and obscure the flow of funds 
through complex multi-national corporate structures. 
 
The LPLA RA found that local and international typologies research uncovered recent cases 
involving suspected TF involving BVIBCs and several terrorist organisations. Moreover, four 
of the five cases related to misuse of a VASP to carry out the TF. The number of cases, and the 
fact that many different terrorist organisations are named, suggests that BVIBCs are more 
susceptible to misuse by terrorist financiers.  No typologies were found relating to other types 
of legal persons and none related to legal arrangements.41The cases analysed show that VI 
entities are found in complex, international structures that could be set up for the benefit of 
sanctioned individuals, terrorist suspects and those linked to terrorist groups or regimes. As 
such, the threat rating from the typologies review exercise suggests a high threat level for 
misuse of VI LPLAs by those seeking to evade sanctions related to terrorism or for TF.  
2.3.1 Terrorist Financing Case Studies – Virtual Assets 
 
While cash, hawala, and traditional money services remain the default tools for TF, the research 
of a reputable Blockchain firm found a growing interest in cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups 
and their supporters. Among cryptocurrency addresses linked to terror financing campaigns, 
there was a 125% increase in TRON addresses in 2023, compared to a 12% increase in Bitcoin 
addresses.42  In particular it was seen that a stablecoin issuer that provides USDT, a fiat-pegged 
digital asset, across multiple blockchains, including TRON, has VI entities in its structure that 
are directly involved in the issuance and management of USDT on the TRON blockchain. 
Specifically, a VI business helps manage how USDT works on different blockchain networks, 
including TRON. This allows people to send, receive, and use USDT easily within the TRON 
system, making it compatible with various apps and services on that network.43 
 
 
41 In relation to legal arrangements, as noted above, there were also no law enforcement cases or SARs or MLA 
requests relating to LA and TF.

Four cases involving VAs and TF/TFS were located during an open-source search. All cases 
involved the alleged misuse of cryptocurrency trading platforms and two related to a trading 
platform, which was launched by a BVIBC.  
 
In one reported case, offshore entities, including two VI entities, played a role in a Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulatory case. One VI-registered entity, affiliated 
with Customer A, continued trading on the platform in question (Finance) despite US 
regulatory concerns, while maintaining a material presence in the US through its affiliates. 
Another VI entity, Customer C, facilitated institutional market participants’ access to various 
cryptocurrency exchanges, while having clear ties to the US. By facilitating access to the 
platform, through nested exchanges and sub-accounts, these entities enabled high-risk 
transactions, including those involving illicit actors, without sufficient safeguards. According 
to the FinCEN Consent Order, user addresses on this platform transacted with wallets linked 
to designated terrorist organisations. FinCEN observed hundreds of direct transactions with 
these organisations, amounting to several hundred thousand dollars, and the platform failed to 
file SARs on these transactions, despite being aware of the risks, with internal communications 
describing flagged transactions as "extremely dangerous for our company". A project linked to 
this platform (Finance) recently established a subsidiary in the VI to enhance its strategic 
Bitcoin asset management44 and a VI AIM licence was also granted to a project associated with 
the same trading platform45. This may make the VI vulnerable to additional TF risk related to 
mixing traditional finance with decentralised finance (DeFi). These platforms often allow 
anonymous transactions, making it easier for criminals to move money without being detected, 
and tokens may be used to move funds across borders without raising alarms due to differences 
in regulations. Privacy tools built into DeFi make it harder to track where money comes from, 
and criminal funds deposited into high-yield products can later be withdrawn as "clean" cash. 
Since these platforms aren’t fully centralised, stopping or reversing suspicious transactions is 
much more difficult.46.

There is evidence that terrorist organisations are accessing virtual asset trading platforms, and 
that such platforms are making it easier for those organisations to raise money outside of their 
countries of origin.47 Middle Eastern terrorist organisations are alleged to have utilised a 
particular trading platform to raise funds and move significant sums, as are other terrorist 
groups and sanctioned individuals. VI entities that facilitate access to such platforms, even 
indirectly, create vulnerabilities that could be exploited for laundering illicit funds, including 
those linked to TF. 
 
A separate exchange with a VI link was utilised in a large-scale crypto scam, as well as being 
used by multiple Jihadist organisations engaging in crypto asset-enabled fundraising48.  
 
The cases analysed show that VI entities are at risk of being involved indirectly in the misuse 
of VAs for TF or the evasion of TFS. VAs are attractive to terrorists, sanctioned individuals, 
and other criminals due to the lack of cohesive global regulation, the ease with which the origin 
of funds may be disguised and the fast pace at which new technology develops. The misuse of 
one trading platform by an international crime organisation, 49 as well as purportedly by 
multiple terrorist groups using similar methods50, further underlines the appeal of this type of 
platform to those seeking to move illicit funds internationally. The presence of VI entities in 
complex, global ownership and control structures for virtual asset service providers can enable 
those providers to blur their ultimate ownership and accountability, and potentially play an 
indirect part in illicit activity, including terrorist funding, that utilises these networks. These

cases show that the threat level of VI entities being utilised in the misuse of virtual asset 
services, whilst still emerging, is evident. 
2.4  Conclusion of Threats to the Virgin Islands 
The threat of domestic terrorism is low. There has never been a terrorism incident and there is 
no intelligence or information relating to any such potential incident. 
 
The threat of TF in the VI as it relates to the use of funds and the collection of funds is low 
whereas the threat as it relates to the movement of funds is Medium-High. The conclusion in 
relation to the four typologies was that typology 1 was of the highest risk at MH, closely 
followed by typology 2 at MH, (consisting of banks – L, MSBs, ML and VASPs MH), typology 
3 was Medium-Low risk (ML) and typology 4 was of the lowest risk (L). 
3. 
Vulnerabilities 
The FATF defines vulnerability as “things that may be exploited by the threat, or that may 
facilitate its activities”. The concept of TF vulnerability comprises those things that can be 
exploited by the TF threat or that may support or facilitate its activities. Vulnerabilities may 
include features of a particular sector, a financial product or type of service that make them 
attractive for TF. Vulnerabilities may also include weaknesses in measures designed 
specifically for CFT, or more broadly in AML/CFT systems or controls, or contextual features 
of a jurisdiction that may impact opportunities for terrorist financiers to raise or move funds or 
other assets (e.g. large informal economy, porous borders etc.). There may be some overlap in 
the vulnerabilities exploited for both ML and TF.51 
 
The absence of known or suspected terrorism and TF cases does not necessarily mean that a 
jurisdiction has a low TF risk. In particular, the absence of cases does not eliminate the potential 
for funds or other assets to be raised and used domestically (for a purpose other than terrorist 
attack) or to be transferred abroad.52 Due to the high volume and cross-border nature of assets 
managed and transferred, international finance centers may be vulnerable to misuse through 
the movement or management of funds or assets linked to terrorist activity.  
 
 
51 FATF TF Risk Assessment Guidance, paragraph 15 
52 FATF TF Risk Assessment Guidance, paragraph 34 
27 | P a g e  
 
The assessment of vulnerabilities was therefore divided into (1) Vulnerabilities of FIs and 
DNFBPs and other specific sectors or areas and (2) Structural vulnerabilities including 
compliance with FATF standards for technical compliance and effectiveness and other 
vulnerabilities at the national level. 
3.1 Vulnerabilities: Individual Regulated Sectors 
Each regulated sector was examined in relation to its vulnerability to TF. This involved 
examining client base, products and services, movement (banking, MSBs, VASPs and DPMS 
only) and distribution channels to establish any links to TF or TF identified higher risk 
countries. Consideration of client base included the nationality and/or residence of clients, or 
BOs of clients, being Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdictions. In relation to distribution channels, 
considerations such as the number of clients onboarded from Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdictions as 
well as the use of online platforms or third-party Eligible Introducers (EIs) based in these 
jurisdictions were considered. When assessing other links to Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries, it was 
assessed whether there was a parent, subsidiary or a director in any of these jurisdictions. 
 
Secondly, broader vulnerabilities were considered in relation to each sector, namely, any 
indication that the SAR filing level was low in relation to the risk rating of the sector, overall 
implementation of CDD obligations/internal controls across the sector, the level of AML/CFT 
compliance and awareness within the sector and the scope of unregulated actors for each of the 
sectors. 53 Finally, the ability of government, law enforcement and/or regulators to share 
information with the private sector54 was also considered. 
 
Data was collected and analysed and the expert opinions of those closest to the sectors were 
sought. The weight of particular factors in relation to their relevance to the sector was also 
considered in determining the overall vulnerability of each sector. 
 
Financial Flows Between the Virgin Islands and Higher-Risk Jurisdictions 
 
 
53 Both as per enforcement and as per information / intelligence (broadly speaking), additionally any gaps in 
regulatory coverage were considered. 
54 Regular meetings with private sector and whether information is shared, whether information on TF risks / 
vulnerabilities is shared, how specific / sensitive this can be, whether there is any prohibition on sharing sensitive 
information, which may lead to further input from private sector (e.g. SAR filing). 
28 | P a g e  
 
Regarding banks, there are no identified fund flows to and from any Tier 1 or Tier 2 
jurisdictions for the relevant period.  In relation to MSBs, financial flows to and from Tier 1 
countries account for less than 1% of all financial flows within that sector55, while flows to 
and from Tier 2 countries account for approximately 5%.56  The countries identified, however, 
align with the migrant population within the VI. 
 
However, in relation to the VASP sector, given the nascent nature of the regime, currently 
there is imprecise data to properly identify fund flows to and from Tier 1 and Tier 2 
jurisdictions.  The geographic location of clientele of VASP applicants is diverse, but with a 
significant concentration in Europe and Asia. The client base in one of the Tier 2 countries 
though smaller in size is growing but is still relatively limited. Australia and South America 
exhibit comparatively lower representation in the clientele demographics. The VASP sector 
therefore poses a risk in relation to the movement of VAs to and from high-risk TF 
jurisdictions. 
3.1.1 Banking 
Banks in the VI are licenced under the Banks and Trust Companies Act, 2020 (as amended) 
(BTCA).  There are currently six commercial banks and one private wealth management 
institution that make up the banking sector within the VI.57  One of the commercial banks is 
domestically owned with the majority shareholder being the Government of the VI.  The other 
five commercial banks are subsidiaries or branches of international banking groups and apply 
AML/CFT measures commensurate with their group.  These institutions are established in 
jurisdictions that have been assessed as having equivalent AML/CFT regimes to the VI. While 
the banking sector is small in terms of the number of licenced institutions, the level of economic 
activity within the sector accounts for approximately 20.6% of economic activity within the 
wider financial services sector.  At the end of 2023, total income within the banking sector was 
$161.7 million or approximately 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with net interest 
income standing at $238.62 million.  Assets held were valued at $2.99 billion. 
 
 
55 1373 transactions to and from Tier 1 countries, valued at $442,654 (0.83% of total transactions). 
56 10,196 transactions to and from Tier 2 countries, valued at $2,701,261. 
57 One of the commercial banks is domestically owned with the majority shareholder being the Government of 
the Virgin Islands.  The other five commercial banks are subsidiaries or branches of international banking groups 
established in jurisdictions that have been assessed as having equivalent AML/CFT regimes to the VI.   
29 | P a g e  
 
The banking sector predominantly provides banking facilities to local residents and businesses.  
However, the sector does provide services to non-resident persons, either directly or through 
the provision of banking services to LPLAs whose BOs and other associated relevant persons 
are non-resident within the Territory.  Six of the seven licenced banks in the VI have clients 
resident in the VI whose nationality is of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdiction.  A total of 13 of those 
clients are nationals of Tier 1 jurisdictions. An additional 74 clients are nationals of Tier 2 
jurisdictions. A full breakdown is contained in the annex. 
 
The products and services offered by these institutions are predominantly offered on a face-to-
face basis and are relatively standard.58  None of the banks within the VI offer prepaid card 
services. It has been found, based on international typologies, that wire transfers that support 
retail, commercial, wealth management, corporate and international transactions may be 
vulnerable to abuse. However, no such abuse has been detected in the VI domestic banking 
system.  Foreign correspondent banking services are not provided by any bank in the Territory.  
However, with the exception of the one domestically owned banks, each bank has relationships 
with overseas banks that provide the local entities with correspondent banking services. Debit 
cards and wire transfers that support corporate and international transactions have been 
identified as being most susceptible to TF globally, yet none of the products and services 
offered by VI banking institutions are considered highly susceptible to TF given the client base 
to which these services are provided cross-border transactions primarily involve transfers to 
and from North America, Asia, the UK and the Caribbean.  None of the banks reported any 
movement of funds to or from any Tier 1 of Tier 2 countries. 
 
Most institutions offer some form of online banking; however, none of the banks in the VI use 
online platforms to onboard clients nor do they engage EIs for onboarding.  A large proportion 
of business is still conducted face-to-face based on the institutions’ infrastructure and the 
products and services offered.    Thus, the delivery channels used are primarily face-to-face, 
including in relation to the on-boarding of clients, although there has been a gradual shift to 
more non-face-to-face transactions as online services have become more readily available 
within the sector.  The FSC is not aware of any parent company or any directors etc. of any 
licenced bank that has links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
58 Such services include Checking and savings accounts, credit cards, residential and commercial mortgages, auto 
and personal loans, time certificates of deposits, wire transfers that support retail, commercial, wealth management, 
corporate and international transactions.   
30 | P a g e  
 
 
SAR filing within this sector is commensurate with general expectations.  Between 2022 and 
2023, 330 SARs were received by the FIA.  However, none of these SARs were TF related. 
The FSC carried out a thematic review of the SAR filings regime by the sector during 2022, 
which identified that proper procedures are in place, and that filings are commensurate with 
type/nature of clientele. The banking sector has robust systems in place and the FSC has not 
had cause to take any enforcement action for any AML/CFT related breach.  FSC’s analysis of 
the compliance officer reports, which are required to be submitted on an annual basis, 
demonstrates that banks are robustly training their staff and that AML/CFT awareness within 
the banking sector is at a high level, as evidenced by the training and testing conducted, as 
documented in the reports. There are no unregulated actors within the banking sector and there 
are no impediments to sharing information with the private sector.59   
 
Table 1 – Banking Sector Vulnerabilities 
 
3.1.2 Money Service Businesses 
MSBs in the VI are licenced and regulated under the Financing and Money Services Act, 2020 
(as amended) (FMSA) and are legally obligated to adhere to the requirements set out in the 
Anti-Money Laundering Regulations, 2020 (as amended) (AMLRs) and the Anti-Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice (AMLTFCOP).  There are only two 
MSBs licenced to operate in the VI and the level of economic activity within the MSB sector 
currently accounts for approximately 3.9% of economic activity within the wider financial 
services sector.  The two licenced MSBs are part of large international money transfer 
 
59 In relation to the FSC and all supervised sectors, information is shared via direct communication with the 
licencees as necessary, along with various media including direct mailings, website postings, online videos, 
webinars, newsletter articles and the FSC’s Meet the Regulator Forums. Types of information shared include 
updates on sanctions listings, public statements on potential fraudulent or unregulated activities, sectoral findings 
of onsite inspections, risk assessment findings, proposals for legislative changes, new filing requirements etc.

organisations with operations throughout the wider Caribbean region and beyond. Services are 
provided through two branches and three representative offices and are limited to money 
transfer services.   
 
The core markets for MSBs within the VI are migrant workers repatriating funds to their home 
countries, and residents sending money abroad primarily for business and educational support 
purposes.  Both MSBs currently service persons residing in the VI whose nationality is of a 
Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdiction.  However, the percentage of these clients in relation to their overall 
client base is negligible.  In 2023 these persons sent and received funds from Tier 1 jurisdictions.  
They also sent and received funds from Tier 2 jurisdictions.   
 
At the end of 2023, MSBs recorded 1373 transactions to and from Tier 1 countries valued at 
$442,654 (0.83% of total transactions).  For that same period, 10,196 transactions to and from 
Tier 2 countries were valued at $2,701,262 (or 5% of total transactions).  Based on labour force 
data the level of remittances is commensurate with the current demographic composition of the 
local labour force. The jurisdictions in question equate to the country of origin of migrant 
workers who tend to repatriate funds to their home countries to support their families.    
 
Furthermore, none of the MSBs use online platforms or EIs to onboard clients.  No parent 
company or director etc. of any licenced MSBs has links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
In relation to the two licenced MSBs, one MSB has been risk-assessed as Medium-Low and 
the other Medium-High. Between 2022 and 2023, seven SARs were filed by the MSB rated as 
Medium-High. Three of these SARs were filed in 2022 and 4 in 2023.  None of the SARs filed 
related to TF. Based on the 2020 TF and 2022 ML RAs the overall risk identified within this 
sector is Medium-Low.  In addition, the nature of the transactions and clientele within the VI 
would not lead to a significant number of SARs. However, the current level of SAR filings is 
not considered commensurate with the risk posed by the sector given its cash intensive nature, 
which somewhat elevates the risk. 
 
The sector is largely compliant with the implementation of CDD and other internal control 
mechanisms as evidenced through inspections and desk-based reviews.  Inspection findings for 
the two MSBs reveal a rating of largely compliant as it relates to conducting CDD and 
verification on customers. There were few to no exceptions regarding CDD, as the established 
32 | P a g e  
 
controls require immediate CDD and verification prior to the conduct of any transactions. AML 
/ CFT compliance and awareness within the sector is at a high level as evidenced by the results 
of onsite and desk-based monitoring and the FSC’s analysis of the annual compliance officer 
reports which document the training and testing conducted by the licenced MSBs. In relation 
to unregulated actors for the MSB sectors, no such activity has been identified by the regulator. 
With respect to sharing information with the private sector, as described above for banking 
there are no impediments to sharing information.60

3.1.3 Insurance61 
The insurance sector in the VI consists of 45 domestic and 38 captive insurance companies, 6 
insurance managers, 12 agents, 2 brokers and 3 loss adjusters.  As of 31st December 2023, there 
were a total of 106 licences. Overall, the level of economic activity within the insurance sector 
accounts for approximately 3.9% of economic activity within the wider financial services 
sector. 
 
No licencees have any clients resident in the VI whose nationality or residency or BO 
nationality or residency is of a Tier 1 jurisdiction.  Five insurance licencees have 494 clients 
resident in the VI whose nationality or residency or BO nationality or residency is of a Tier 2 
jurisdiction.  This constitutes approximately 1% of the sector’s client base.   The current 
products offered by the insurance sector are not generally susceptible to TF abuse.62 Further, 
 
60 See footnote above regarding means by which information is shared with the sector. 
61 Entities seeking to carry out insurance business in or from within the VI must be licenced under the Insurance 
Act, 2008.    
62 Property and casualty (homeowners, liability, fire and perils, builder's risk, business interruption, burglary) life 
and health (life policies, annuities, accidental, health) and marine (marine hull, cargo) insurance 
33 | P a g e  
 
no insurer or insurance intermediary uses online platforms or EIs to onboard clients.  The FSC 
is not aware of any parent company or directors etc. of any licenced insurer or insurance 
intermediary having links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
Between 2022 and 2023, twelve SARs were filed by the insurance sector, none of which related 
to any TF or TFS activity. SAR filings are commensurate with risk within the sector, where 
most products in the domestic market are low risk and not susceptible to TF risk.  The sector 
is largely compliant with the implementation of CDD and other internal control mechanisms 
as evidenced through inspections and desk-based reviews. FSC’s analysis of training and 
testing conducted by the sector as outlined in the annual compliance officer reports confirms 
that AML/CFT compliance and awareness is at a high level within the insurance sector. There 
is no evidence that there is unregulated activity taking place in this sector and there are no 
impediments to sharing information with entities within the sector.

3.1.4 Investment Business63 
All IB licences are subject to the Securities and Investment Business Act, 2020 (as amended) 
(SIBL) and the relevant regulations emanating from this, and licences may be granted in one 
or more categories to conduct various activities. In the VI, the IB sector includes six general 
categories: Investment Fund Vehicles, Asset and Investment Managers and Advisers, 
Brokers/Dealers, Asset and Investment Administrators, Custodians and Investment Exchanges. 
At the end of 2023, 230 entities held various categories of IB licences.  
 
 
63 To provide IB in or from within the VI, entities must be licenced by the FSC. 
34 | P a g e  
 
Investment management and advisory services make up the majority of the IB sector, with 
equity investments and shares making up the majority of assets held.  In December 2023, 
investment funds registered in the VI had a total net asset value of approximately US$728 
billion.  However, the level of economic activity within the IB sector accounts for less than 5% 
of economic activity within the wider financial services sector in the VI.  
 
The transactions involving this sector overall are significantly large, both in terms of the 
number of transactions and aggregate size of those transactions, with clientele geographically 
dispersed worldwide and engaging in cross-border transactions.64  There is a rather small group 
of licencees (8) that provides custody services which is minimal and not consequential, given 
the limited number of transactions they execute.  
 
At the end of 2023, twenty-seven IB licencees (mainly brokers (99%)) had clients whose 
nationality or residency or BO nationality or residency was of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdiction. 
Of those 27 entities, 14 licencees service 48,968 clients who are nationals of Tier 1 jurisdictions 
(all individuals except for one company), which accounts for 10% of those 14 licencees’ client 
bases and 3.2% of the sector’s total client base. In addition, 26 of the 27 licencees service 
69,584 clients who are nationals of Tier 2 jurisdictions (111 companies and 69486 individuals).  
This accounts for 14% of the 26 licencees’ client base and 4.6% of the total IB sector client 
base. 
 
Of the products and services offered by IBs, transferable securities, mutual funds and derivative 
products are internationally recognised as being most susceptible to TF abuse65. 51 licencees 
or 11% of IBs offer derivative products (primarily offered by brokerage entities). Twenty-five 
IB licencees use online platforms for onboarding. With regard to the use of EIs, no IB licencees 
conduct business with EIs in any Tier 1 countries.  However, licencees engage a small number 
of EIs from Tier 2 countries.  
 
The FSC has not identified any parent company branch/subsidiary, directors etc. of any 
licenced IB with links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
 
64 IB entities engage with regulated banks and the transactions are primarily fund, asset and securities trading. 
65 FATF Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Securities Sector October 2009 
35 | P a g e  
 
Analysis of risk data shows associated risk primarily in the brokerage sub-sector. Other 
subsectors such as management of funds demonstrate a lower level of risk than brokerage 
services, given the clientele.  Overall, SAR filings are generally considered low in comparison 
to the overall risk associated with the IB sector. Between 2022 and 2023 a total of 87 SARs 
were filed by licencees accounting for 5% of the IB sector.   
 
Thirteen inspections were conducted during the period 2020 – 2022, with eleven inspections 
focusing on the level of implementation of CDD obligations. Results indicated that CDD 
obligations are carried out, as only three of the eleven licencees inspected received a rating less 
than largely compliant.  All other IB licencees received a rating of Compliant or Largely 
Compliant, evidencing the establishment and implementation of appropriate CDD controls.  
 
Analysis of AML/CFT returns data indicates a satisfactory level of awareness of AML/CFT 
measures. Some level of compliance is evident from onsite inspections as well with a majority 
of entities reviewed receiving a rating of Largely Compliant and Compliant as it relates to CDD 
and verification.  
 
 FSC’s policing the perimeter has found that the scope of unregulated activity is limited.66 Most 
investigations into unregulated activity reveal that identified activities are carried out by 
entities purporting to be VI entities but in fact are not registered, incorporated and/or have any 
connection to the Territory. The results of these investigations conducted between 2020 and 
2023 revealed that fake licencees and bogus businesses fraudulently claiming to be authorised 
and licenced in the VI to conduct IB account for 11% of the total investigations. Public 
statements were issued on the FSC’s website to alert the public about potential scams or 
fraudulent activities that may result in financial loss. Further, 13 investigations relative to 
complaints regarding IB Licencees were referred to the Supervisory Divisions. The basis for 
the complaints related to unresponsiveness of the licencees and matters concerning withdrawal 
policies. Only 4 of the 6 policing the perimeter investigations conducted between 2020 to 2023 
involved BVIBCs.  The other 42 involved non-BVIBCs purporting to be BVIBCs. 
 
 
66 It should be noted here that while the policing the perimeter activities involve looking for any signs of 
unauthorised business in any sector. The current findings relate to IBs and VASPs. This is generally consistent 
with international typologies where unauthorised banking, insurance and fiduciary business are rare. 
36 | P a g e  
 
There are no impediments with regard to sharing information with the IB sector.67

3.1.5 Financing 
Under the FMSA, the definition of Financing Business (FB) includes the provision of a wide 
range of credit services including pay day advances, consumer finance loans under a financing 
agreement to a borrower in the VI, leasing property under financing lease agreements, cheque 
cashing and international financing and lending.  Only FBs that operate physically in the VI 
are subject to authorisation and supervision.   There are three licenced FBs in the Territory. 
Prior to Q2 2024 there were only two licencees, one of which serviced around 772 clients in 
2023, executing approximately 408 transactions.   The average value of the transactions was 
$2 million. Services provided are limited to small micro loans and short-term loans to persons 
within the organisations. The other licence conducted a total of 824 transactions in 2023 with 
an average value of $5,828 per transaction. 
 
No licenced FB has clients who are nationals or residents, or whose BO is a national or resident, 
of any Tier 1 Tier 2 countries. Given the types of services provided, none of the products 
offered by FBs in the VI are vulnerable to TF abuse no do any FBs use online platforms or EIs 
to onboard clients.  There are no branches or subsidiaries and none of the parent companies’ 
directors etc. of any licencees have links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
 
67 See footnote above regarding means by which information is shared with the sector. 
37 | P a g e  
 
The risk of TF within the financing sector, given its size and products offered, is extremely low.  
No SARs have been received from the financing sector within the reporting period. However, 
given the narrow focus of the sector, this is commensurate with risk and clientele. CDD and 
internal controls have been implemented, and desk-based reviews find that these systems are 
adequate and fit for purpose. AML/CFT compliance and awareness within the sector is at a 
high level as evidenced by training conducted. The FSC’s analysis of the compliance officer 
reports demonstrates that FB licencees are robustly training their staff.  In relation to 
unregulated active, there was one instance where an unregulated actor, who was identified and 
a fine issued.  That entity has since been licenced. There are no impediments to sharing 
information with the sector.

3.1.6 Insolvency  
In order to accept an appointment as an administrator, administrative receiver, interim 
supervisor, supervisor, provisional liquidator, liquidator (other than in a solvent liquidation) or 
bankruptcy trustee, an Insolvency Practitioner (IP) must be licenced, as provided for under the 
Insolvency Act, 2003. Overseas IPs must be appointed jointly with a VI licenced IP in instances 
where such an appointment is required.  IPs in the VI comprise mainly accountants and legal 
practitioners who are part of accountancy or law firms.  Their legal obligations, including 
AML/CFT obligations, however, relate only to them in their personal capacities and are not 
transferred to the firms. In 2023, there were 29 fully licenced IPs (an increase from 27 in 2020). 
Between 2020 and 2023, 305 insolvency appointments were made.  In the vast majority of 
cases, these appointments were related to the winding up/liquidation of non-regulated legal 
persons i.e., BVIBCs.  
38 | P a g e  
 
  
With regard to insolvency services, the client base may include international Politically 
Exposed Persons (PEPs) and businesses operating in high-risk jurisdictions (for ML or TF).  
However, the general nature of insolvency business not being on-going business makes the risk 
of the sector being used for any TF purposes extremely miniscule and may come primarily in 
the possibility of potential collusion between the IP and the client.  However, there have been 
no reported instances where a BVI IP has been linked to any TF-related activity. Further, due 
to the nature of insolvency business, no IP uses online platforms or EIs to onboard clients.   
 
Given the nature of insolvency services, the risk of TF within the sector is extremely low and 
SAR filings are commensurate with this level of risk. Between 2022 and 2023, IPs filed 
nineteen (19) SARs with the FIA, none of which related to any TF activity. There are no 
identified issues with implementation of CDD obligations / internal controls across the sector 
or with AML/CFT compliance and awareness within the sector. There are no impediments to 
sharing information with the sector. Unregistered activities are nonexistent given the 
requirements under the relevant legislation to be approved to deal with insolvent liquidations.

3.1.7 Virtual Asset Service Providers68 
VASPs are registered under the Virtual Asset Service Provider Act (VASPA) which came into 
force in 2023. However, VASPs have been subject to AML/CFT requirements since December 
 
68 VAs are also posing increasing TF risks, including for fundraising by ISIL, Al Qaeda and right-wing extremist 
groups, although the vast majority of terrorist financing still takes place using fiat currency. Virtual Assets: 
Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF standards, 2023 
39 | P a g e  
 
2022.  Registration of VASPs began in 2024.  Data provided on VASPs will, therefore, cover 
activity within 2024.69   
 
As of Q4 2024, there had been 65 applicants for registration, 9 of which have been registered 
under the VASPA thus far. Nine applicants (all startups that had not yet launched) withdrew 
their applications and four applications were refused. Of the 43 applications pending decision, 
33 are established entities subject to the transitional provisions and are currently undertaking 
business and 10 are new applicants which have not commenced business.70  
 
The FSC understands and expects that numbers in relation to customers serviced and 
transaction sizes will be high and remains engaged with applicants to address deficiencies 
identified in policies and procedures as well as effectiveness for established business. 
Applicants have been required to submit responses related to their current book of business, 
outsourcing arrangements, risk management and AML provisions.  
 
Current data from applicants suggests that there is significant activity related to VASP 
Exchanges and Custody emanating from the VI.  Specifically, current data indicates that 
medium-sized custodians and exchanges operating from within the VI have over 5 million 
customers in each category. 
 
Noting the elevated AML/CFT risk that VASPs pose to consumers and the jurisdiction’s 
reputation, the FSC has prioritised the review and completion of VASPs who currently have a 
material portion of their client base in Tier 1 & Tier 2 jurisdictions as well as applicants that 
have filed a notable number of SARs.

69 The FSC remains engaged with applicants to address deficiencies identified in policies and procedures as well 
as effectiveness for established business. Applicants have been required to submit responses related to their current 
book of business, outsourcing arrangements, risk management and AML provisions.  
70 At the time of the risk assessment, it was anticipated that all applicants would be decided upon by the end of 
Q1 2025.

54% of the applications received are solely VASP (not providing custody or exchange services) 
which tend to pose a lower level of risk than those that provide custody or exchange services. 
Thirty (30%) of applications are combined business models of VASP custodians and VASP 
exchanges or the trifecta of all three registration types. In relation to established VASPs seeking 
registration, 32 of the applicants were compliant or largely compliant with AML/CFT 
requirements, 19 were partially compliant and 4 were non-compliant. The 4 non-compliant 
established entities were refused in Q4 of 2024.  For startups, 7 were compliant or largely 
compliant with AML/CFT requirements and 3 were found to be partially compliant.  
In terms of scale, the size of current businesses operating in the VASP sector varies widely, 
ranging from small entities with around 20 clients that focus on specialised services such as 
staking and crypto asset financing, to large enterprises serving up to 200,000 clients. Larger 
entities are likely involved in a broader array of activities, including virtual asset custody and 
comprehensive trading platforms.   
 
While the client base for a number of smaller VASPs is primarily dominated by institutional 
clients, including large financial entities such as banks, investment funds, pension funds, and 
insurance companies, retail clients, who are individual investors engaging in the virtual asset 
market for personal investment or speculative purposes, form a significant portion of the client 
base of the larger VASPs such as custodians and exchanges and therefore account for the 
majority of clients across all VASPs. High net worth individuals and institutions, such as family 
offices and private wealth management firms, as well as corporations like tech companies, 
fintech startups, and large enterprises seeking to diversify their balance sheets, also play a 
41 | P a g e  
 
substantial role. On the other hand, miners and traders, both professional and amateur, 
contribute to the client base to a lesser extent.  
 
The FSC notes that a number of applicants operating from within the VI not only have a large 
client base, but also hold a significant market share within the global virtual asset space with 4 
applicants ranking in the top 20 virtual asset exchanges globally, solely based on trading 
volume.  
 
 The products and services offered by VASPs that are most susceptible to TF include exchanges, 
Over-the-counter (OTC) services, VA wallets71 and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). A total of 
25 VASPs have sought registration to operate as exchanges. From the responses thus far, 7 are 
offering OTC services and 2 are offering wallet services, and engaging in the sale of NFTs. 
 
The number and value of transactions to and from or connected to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries 
is currently unknown. Initial engagement with applicants indicates that a majority of applicants 
currently use online platforms for onboarding. At present, 4.4% of applicants have clients in 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. There are currently no directors linked to Tier 1 countries. However, 
there are 12 directors currently linked to Tier 2 countries. There are also no parent companies 
linked to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
The concentration of clients in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions (97%) is predominantly held 
across 3 applicants, 2 of whom are in the same VASP Exchange group. The FSC has identified 
9,035 clients across ten of the twelve Tier 1 countries (none in Iran or Syria), approximately 
90% of which were Nigeria and Pakistan and 77,309 clients across each of the nineteen Tier 2 
countries.  See Table 8 below.

Currently there are fifteen VASPs with clients in Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 jurisdictions, eight of 
which have clients in Tier 1 jurisdictions. All fifteen have clients in Tier 2 jurisdictions. The 
number of companies with offerings in each high-risk jurisdiction is detailed below.

Some larger applicants filed a notable number of SARs between 2022 and 2023. Of those 
applicants, the exchanges with a significant market-share filed roughly 3,952 SARs during 
2022 and 5,860 during 2023, a Y-on-Y increase of 48%. The filings are consistent with the 
identified risk within the VASP sector but also indicative of adherence to the AML laws that 
came into effect on 1 December 2022, and continued application of AML screenings. Between 
2022 and 2023, seven VASPs filed 83 SARs related to potential TF-related activity which 
speaks to this level of risk. The TF risk is elevated in this sector. 
 
The FSC has taken steps to identify VASPs that are not registered or did not apply prior to the 
end of the 6-month transition period following the coming into force of the VASPA.  Steps 
include investigations by the Enforcement Division (ED) and Specialised Supervision Unit 
(SSU). In one case a public statement was issued, and the entity was struck off and subsequently 
dissolved. In addition, the FSC has issued 46 public statements warning persons of various 
entities and individuals who have been found to be carrying out unauthorised business, 
including unauthorized VASP-related activities.72  Between 2019 and April 2024, the FSC 
initiated investigations into 63 persons for fraudulent activities related to VAs activities. None 
of these related to TF. The Enforcement Division also investigated a total of 71 
complaints/inquiries relating to 38 persons purporting to be registered/incorporated VI 
Companies or licenced entities with the FSC. None of these related to TF.  
 
There are no impediments to sharing information with the private sector.  Information is shared 
via various media including direct mailings, website postings, online videos, webinars, 
newsletter articles and the FSC’s Meet the Regulator Forums. Types of information shared 
include RA findings, proposals for legislative changes, new filing requirements etc.

Use of Virtual Assets73 
 
In order to assess the use of VAs within the jurisdiction, the extent to which VAs were accepted 
by each of the regulated sectors outside of VASPs was considered74 along with the prevalence 
of the use of VAs in the jurisdiction. An estimate was made on the number of users in the VI 
using open-source publications such as Chainalysis annual reports. 
 
VAs are not used or accepted in the banking sector for general banking purposes. One bank 
provides services to persons in the VAs space but more so as holding capital on behalf of the 
VASP.  Banks do not trade in or offer trading in VA.  No FB currently use or accept VAs as a 
form of payment for services. IPs do not use or accept VAs as a form of payment for services. 
VAs are not used in the MSB sector or the insurance sector. 
 
Based on the findings of the Risk Assessment Questionnaire for 2024, VAs are not accepted 
or used in the accounting sector, the real estate sector, the DPMS sector or the HVGD sector. 
Two entities provide virtual asset services in the capacity of legal advice. Outside of the VASP 
sub-sector, only a very limited number of IBs use or accept VA.  No other sub-sector currently 
uses or accepts VAs as a form of payment for services.  
 
Only a very limited number of IB brokers accept VA for payments and these payments 
constitute only 10% of total payments received by these brokers.  No other sub-sector currently 
uses or accepts VAs as a form of payment for services except for the one licenced exchange 
 
73 Virtual assets are also posing increasing terrorist financing risks, including for fundraising by ISIL, Al Qaeda 
and right-wing extremist groups, although the vast majority of terrorist financing still takes place using fiat 
currency. Virtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF standards, 2023 
74 The sector involves the trading and exchange of virtual assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. 
45 | P a g e  
 
which indicated that all payments are made via VAs as it provides services in relation to 
derivatives for VAs.  
 
Prepaid payment cards are not available in the VI, nor are VAs accepted for public sector 
payments. However, there are few instances of acceptance of VA for payment in the private 
sector. The use of VA as a payment means in the VI is minimal. HMC has not received any 
declarations for cold wallets or mining equipment. There is, however, a growing number of 
BVIBCs that provide VASP services or involved with VAs, particularly cryptocurrencies.  
 
Since June 2023, the GO has received an increase of reports of suspected/attempted sanctions 
breaches involving funds being transited through VI VASPs. This trend is being closely 
monitored by the GO, FIA and FSC and investigations regarding suspected involvement of VI 
VASPs in TF are underway. However, the majority of reports received involve the same 
BVIBC. 
 
VAs and virtual asset platforms are attractive to terrorists because they provide a high level of 
anonymity that terrorists can exploit to move funds without detection. This makes it difficult 
for authorities to trace the identity of the individuals involved in the transaction as well as its 
purpose. 
3.1.8 Trust and Corporate Service Providers 
Since 1990, TCSPs have been classified as financial institutions and are licenced and regulated 
in accordance with the BTCA and the Company Management Act, 2020 (as amended) 
(CMA). In the VI, TCSPs fall into two general categories: 
 
• Corporate Services Providers (CSPs)– these TCSPs engage primarily in company 
management and administration services including the provision of nominee 
shareholder and directorship services; and 
• Trust Services Providers (TSPs) – these TCSPs engage in the provision of trustee and 
other related services to trusts. 
 
At the end of 2023, 287 entities were licenced to operate under the BTCA or CMA in one of 
the six classes of licences.   Of those 287 licenced TCSPs, 183 TCSPs are part of larger groups 
of companies operating either in other international finance centres where they are licenced or 
authorised, while 20 are part of larger groups operating locally.  Nineteen CSPs are also 
46 | P a g e  
 
affiliated with legal or accounting firms operating within the Territory.  Approximately 65 are 
independent operators.  
 
Corporate Services Providers: At the end of 2023, 103 or 36% of the 287 TCSPs licenced in 
the Territory had the ability to provide company management services.  This included provision 
of RA services to 340,796 BVIBCs who at the end of 2023 were active on the Companies 
Register (i.e., in good standing and in compliance with the BVIBCA), 2,042 active limited 
partnerships and 56 active foreign companies.  Only CSPs that are categorised as RAs are 
permitted to incorporate or register legal persons. CSPs may also provide services such as 
directorship services and nominee shareholder services. A majority of all TCSPs (68%) have 
the ability to offer corporate director services. Further, 68% of all TCSPs have the ability to 
provide nominee shareholder services. 
 
Trust Services Providers: At the end of 2023, 126 (or 44%) of the 287 TCSPs were licenced 
to provide trust related services, with 74 licenced exclusively to provide trust services.  The 
latter accounts for 26% of all licenced TCSPs.  At the end of 2023 there were 6,742 express 
trusts under administration by TSPs valued at approximately $171.08 billion.  In addition, TSPs 
held 1,115 trusts under the VI Special Trusts Act, 2003.   
 
Some companies that act as trustee or provide other trust related services, particularly for a 
group of related family trusts, are recognised as Private Trust Companies (PTCs) 75 and are 
exempted from the licencing requirement under the BTCA. At the end of 2023 there were 1,085 
PTCs established in the VI. In June 2022, the FSC reviewed the level of compliance by relevant 
Class I licencees authorised to provide services to PTCs76 and found they had adequate 
policies and procedures in place and were taking steps to risk assess these PTCs and monitor 
their ongoing compliance. Copies of trust documents for the trusts that PTCs act for were 
available at the TCSPs offices as required. It was also found that the majority of PTCs provide 
unremunerated services. PTCs, on average, provide services to less than two (1.3) trusts, which 
are generally family or related trust structures. The average Assets Under Management per trust 
 
75 A PTC is considered a relevant person for AML/CFT purposes and is required to comply with the AML Code, 
AML Regulations and all other relevant AML/CFT requirements in the VI. 
76 This was partially in relation to assessing whether these TCSPs had proper policies in place, had risk-assessed 
the PTCs, maintained the required documentation, and had proper measures in place to monitor the PTCs to get 
an understanding of the size of the PTC sector in terms of number of trusts for which they act, the services provided 
(i.e. unremunerated or related services) and to factor the findings into FSC’s risk-based approach to supervision 
of these entities. 
47 | P a g e  
 
is approximately $13m. The data gathered was used to update the RAs of the relevant Class I 
TCSP licencees and increase the FSC’s understanding of risk posed by PTCs and the legal 
arrangements they acted for.  
 
One hundred and eleven TCSPs have clients whose nationality or residency, or whose BO’s 
nationality or residency, is of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 jurisdiction.  Those entities service 3317 clients 
who are nationals of Tier 1 jurisdictions and make up 0.07% of the total client base within the 
TCSP sector. These entities also service 31,795 clients who are nationals of Tier 2 jurisdictions, 
which make up 6.7% of the total TCSP sector client base.  These clients are a combination of 
end users and clients engaged by way of third-party introductions. 
 
Of the products and services offered by TCSPs incorporation services (offered by 36% of 
TCSPs), trust services (offered by 44% of TCSPs), and nominee services (offered by 68% of 
TCSPs) are most susceptible to TF abuse77, in addition to Introduced Business Relationships 
which are used by 30% of TCSPs. No TCSPs use online platforms for onboarding. TCSPs do, 
however, engage a small number of EIs from Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries when onboarding 
clients (details in the annex). To the FSC’s knowledge, no parent company, branch/subsidiary, 
directors etc. of any licenced TCSP have links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries. 
 
Between 2022 and 2023, the FIA received 448 SARs from entities within the TCSP sector, of 
which 2 SARs, which were filed by the same TCSP, related to potential TF-related activity. 
Given the size of, and inherent risk within the TCSP sector 78 , SARs filings are not 
commensurate with risk within the sector.   
 
Implementation of CDD and internal controls across the sector is satisfactory but requires 
improvement though entities generally have controls in place. For the period 2020 – 2023, 
TCSPs were generally compliant with the requirement to undertake CDD and inquire into the 
circumstances of the customer. Specifically, during 2020 – 2023, Six  CSPs were assessed for 
CDD, and all received a rating of Largely Compliant. Regarding EDD, there were fifteen 
inspections conducted which assessed licencees’ effective implementation of their EDD 
procedures, of which twelve TCSPs demonstrated deficiencies. Of the 12, Nine  TCSPs (60%)

48 | P a g e  
 
were rated as Partially Compliant whilst three TCSPs (20%) were rated as non-compliant. The 
remaining three TCSPs (20%) had minor or no deficiencies.79 
 
AML/CFT awareness within the sector is high. Data from Compliance Officer reports and other 
desk-based reviews show continuous training and development. Onsite inspections generally 
find training is undertaken as required. Additionally, no unregulated activities have been 
discovered as, given the services provided and the fact that all entities require an agent to be 
incorporated, unregulated activity in this sector is generally unlikely. 80  There are no 
impediments to sharing information with the private sector.81

3.1.9 Accountants 
In 2023, there were 18 registered accountants, of whom 7 were also licensed IPs and 5 were 
registered accounting firms which engage in general accounting activities such as auditing and 
not relevant business. The remaining 6 conducted relevant financial business in accordance 
with the AMLTFCOP, which made them subject to AML/CFT supervision by the FIA. The 
sum value of the transactions conducted by these six registered accountants for 2023 was 
$287,277,673, for those also carrying out insolvency business the sum value of transactions 
conducted for 2023 was $1,779,656,509.73.  
 
Out of the total client base there were no clients from Tier 1, there were 2 from Tier 2 (UAE).  
One entity had a BO from Tier 1 (Pakistan) and 2 entities had BOs from a Tier 2 country 
 
79 2 were largely compliant and 1 was compliant. 
80 Given the services provided and the fact that all entities require an agent to be incorporated, unregulated activity 
in this sector is generally unlikely. 
81 For methods of how the information is shared see the footnote above regarding banking.

(Philippines).  Wire transfers and checks are the main methods of payment used by the sector. 
Between 2021 and 2023 10 SARs were filed by 3 entities which is commensurate with its risk 
given the size and nature of the sector..  
 
A total of 90% of the accountants have written AML/CFT/CPF compliance programmes. Some 
of these firms form part of larger international firms with established business relationships 
across the globe.  In relation to those accountants who are insolvency practitioners, there are 
no identified issues with implementation of CDD obligations/internal controls nor with 
AML/CFT compliance and awareness according to FSC. Between September 2024 – October 
2024, FIA-SEU conducted and concluded onsite inspections on two accounting firms for the 
period 2021 – 2023. Each accountant received a rating of partially compliant with the 
requirement to undertake appropriate and adequate risk-based CDD and ECDD measures. This 
was due deficiencies in the conduct of their institutional / customer risk assessment and their 
ability to accurately identify risk and apply the appropriate mitigating measures.  AML/CFT 
policies and procedure were in place but were not sufficiently risk-based and tailored to 
commensurate with the risks of the entities due to the deficiencies identified in institutional / 
customer risk assessment. However, there are general measures such as screening, monitoring 
and reporting in place to mitigate TF risk. The entities have a general understanding and 
knowledge of their AML/CFT obligations but there is room for improvement. 
 
In relation to unregulated actors, accountants that engage in the relevant activities are 
registered.. 82 registration is an ongoing process as new businesses are licenced with the 
Ministry of Trade daily. In relation to all its supervised sectors, the FIA-SEU, in an effort to 
ensure that all relevant businesses are registered with the FIA (a) issues an annual notice 
reminding entities of their obligation to register with the FIA once they are engaging in the 
relevant business and, (b) engages in “policing the perimeter” exercises in which, based on the 
list of licenced entities submitted by the Ministry of Trade, the FIA-SEU contacts new or 
existing entities to verify whether they are conducting the relevant activities and , if so, require 
that they complete and submit the relevant forms and supporting documents for registration 
purposes. It is therefore possible that there are new entities operating who are not yet registered 
for a very temporary period. All efforts are made to ensure entities conducting relevant

activities to the FIA-SEU (accounting, lawyers and notaries, real estate agents, DPMS and HVGD). 
50 | P a g e  
 
activities are registered. To date the FIA has not identified any accountants operating without 
authorisation and therefore no action was taken for failure to register. 
 
There are no barriers for the sharing of information with the private sector. The FIA-SEU 
provides guidance and training to the accounting sector and communicates effectively via email 
and telephone. Whenever the FIA-SEU receives a new sanction listing it is immediately sent 
out to the entire DNFBP sector. As it is usually the Money Laundering Reporting Officers 
(MLROs) or the compliance team who are responsible for reporting sanctions breaches, the 
FIA SEU also liaises with these persons regarding sanctions breaches to keep them abreast of 
any new designation.

3.1.10 Lawyers and Notaries 
In 2023, there were 36 registered entities which related to a sum value of $33,262, 227,558.50 
in transactions conducted for 2023.  One entity had clients in a Tier 1 country, 11 entities had 
clients in Tier 2 countries. There were no BOs related to Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries. There was 
one investigation involving a lawyer’s client, but the lawyer was not conducting relevant 
financial business. Wire transfers and checks are the main methods of payment accepted.  There 
are negligible cash transactions accepted. A total of 26 of the entities use online platforms for 
onboarding. No entities have links to Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries through affiliations or offices. 
 
Between the years 2021- 2023, only 35 SARs were filed by 8 entities. This is not commensurate 
with risk given the size of, and inherent risk within the Legal sector. 
 
51 | P a g e  
 
96% of the firms possess a written AML/CFT/CPF compliance programme. Additionally, the 
VI has established global firms who have long-standing offices within the Territory and as such, 
have in place global compliance policies, procedures, control and systems to ensure compliance 
with AML/CFT regulatory requirements.  
Registration is an ongoing process as new businesses are licenced with the Ministry of Trade 
frequently. The FIA-SEU, in an effort to ensure that all relevant businesses are registered with 
the FIA, takes relevant steps as outlined above for accountants. 9 new legal practitioners were 
recently registered with the FIA-SEU and attended the new registrant webinar on 18 February 
2025. Measures are taken to ensure that all entities conducting the relevant activities are 
registered 
with 
the 
FIA.   
The FIA has not identified any lawyers operating without authorisation and therefore, no action 
has been taken for failure to register. 
There are no barriers for the sharing of information with the private sector. The FIA-SEU 
provides guidance and training to the legal practitioner sector and communicates effectively 
via email and telephone. The FIA-SEU sends sanctions updates immediately to all DNFBP 
sectors as well as liaises periodically with the MLROs via email to keep them abreast of any 
new designations.  
 
Between September 2024 and October 2024, the FIA-SEU conducted onsite inspections on ten 
firms for the period 2021 – 2023. 7 of the entities received a largely compliant rating for 
undertaking appropriate and adequate CDD and ECDD measures which are risk-based. The 
three remaining entities received partially compliant mainly due deficiencies in the conduct of 
their institutional / customer risk assessment and their ability to accurately identify risk and 
apply the appropriate mitigating measures.  Additionally, the onsite examinations and desk-
based reviews further found that the international/global law firms are compliant with their 
CDD obligations and have implemented adequate and effective internal controls to mitigate 
risks, especially in relation to TF risk as there are robust systems in place which facilitate 
sanction screening, monitoring and reporting. Further, these firms are very aware of their 
AML/CFT obligations as they are part of global firms and have comply with international 
standards.  However, while the smaller local law firms have some deficiencies in their general 
AML/CFT framework, they have some internal controls in place. These local firms have a 
general understanding of their AML/CFT obligations.

3.1.11 Real Estate Agents 
In 2023, there were 13 registered Real Estate Agents (REAs) involving transactions whose sum 
value was $59,424,037 million. There were no clients, BOs or other links to Tier 1 or Tier 2 
countries. There was one international typology in relation to the sale of real estate for TF 
purposes, however given the strict limits on such purchases in the VI83 this was excluded. Wire 
transfers, cheques, cash and bank financing are the main payment methods accepted by the real 
estate sector. Between the years 2021- 2023, only 1 SAR was filed by 1 entity, which is below 
what would be commensurate with risk.  
 
In 2024, the FIA-SEU conducted an onsite inspection on four real estates for the period 2021 
– 2023. Each entity received a rating of partially compliant with the requirement to undertake 
appropriate and adequate risk-based CDD and ECDD measures. This was due deficiencies in 
the conduct of their institutional / customer risk assessment and their ability to accurately 
identify risk and apply the appropriate mitigating measures. Additionally, the AML/CFT 
policies and procedure in place, were not risk-based and tailored to be commensurate with the 
risks of the entities due to the deficiencies identified in institutional / customer risk assessment. 
However, there are general measures such as screening and reporting in place to mitigate TF 
risk. Most of the entities have a general understanding and knowledge of their AML/CFT 
obligations but there is much room for improvement. 
 
 
83 Foreign persons seeking to purchase property must apply for a licence (non-belonger land holding licence, 
‘NBLHL’) which takes between three and nine months to obtain and consists of stringent requirements. 
53 | P a g e  
 
In relation to unregulated actors within the real estate sector, most of the REAs that engage in 
the relevant activities are registered with the FIA. As with other DNFBP sectors registration is 
an ongoing process as new businesses are licenced with the Ministry of Trade daily. The FIA-
SEU issues an annual notice and engages in policing the perimeter abased on the list of licenced 
entities, the FIA-SEU contacts new or existing entities to verify whether they are conducting 
relevant activities and, if so, requires the relevant forms to be completed. Additionally, some 
entities contact the FIA-SEU for information regarding registration. The Ministry of Trade 
periodically provides a list to the FIA-SEU of entities that are licenced and engaged in the 
relevant activities to the FIA-SEU. 
 
There are limited barriers to the sharing of information with the private sector. The FIA-SEU 
provides guidance and training to the Real Estate sector and communicates effectively via 
email and telephone. The FIA-SEU also sends sanctions listings periodically to the MLRO or 
designated person of the REA via email to keep them abreast of any new designation.

3.1.12 Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones 
In 2023 there were 5 registered DPMS, with total revenue of $1,607,389. None of these entities 
has clients in Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries. Two entities had beneficial owners in a Tier 2 country 
(India and Israel although no longer residing there and one BO out of the five resided in the 
VI). There was no evidence to suggest any movement to or from Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries or 
connection with Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries. Additionally, there were no suppliers in Tier 1 or 
Tier 2 countries or any links to TF. 
 
54 | P a g e  
 
Between the years 2021- 2023, no SARs were filed by the DPMS sector (although one SAR 
was filed in 2024) which is not commensurate with the risk within the sector. 
 
In 2024, the FIA-SEU conducted an onsite inspection on four DPMS for the period 2021 – 
2023. Each entity received a rating of partially compliant with the requirement to undertake 
appropriate and adequate risk-based CDD and ECDD measures. This was due deficiencies in 
the conduct of their institutional / customer risk assessment and their ability to accurately 
identify risk and apply the appropriate mitigating measures. Additionally, the AML/CFT 
policies and procedures in place, were not risk-based and tailored to the risks of the entities due 
to the deficiencies identified in institutional / customer risk assessment. However, there are 
general measures such as screening and reporting in place to mitigate TF risk. Therefore, most 
of the entities have a general understanding of their AML/CFT obligations, but further training 
and guidance are required to foster better understanding of their AML/CFT obligations and 
risks. General AML / CFT training was undertaken but needed to be more specific in the area 
of TF.  
 
In relation to unregulated actors within the sector, most of the DPMS that engage in the relevant 
activities are registered with the FIA-SEU. In addition, the Ministry of Trade periodically 
provides the FIA-SEU with a list of entities that are licenced and engaging in the relevant 
activities to the FIA-SEU. The FIA-SEU issues an annual notice to remind entities of the 
obligation to register and also policies the perimeter based on the list of licenced entities 
submitted by the Ministry of Trade. The FIA-SEU contacts new or existing entities to verify 
whether they are conducting relevant activities and, if so, requires that they complete and 
submit the relevant forms and supporting documents for registration purposes. The FIA-SEU 
has not identified any entities operating without authorisation and therefore, there was no action 
taken for failure to register. There are no barriers for the sharing of information with the private 
sector. The FIA-SEU provides guidance and training to the DPMS sector and communicates 
effectively via email and telephone. The FIA-SEU sends sanctions listings periodically to the 
MLRO of the DPMS via email to keep them abreast of any new designation. 
 
Goods in the VI are primarily imported from the US mainland. There has also been an increase 
of importation of goods from China but none from high-risk TF countries. There has never 
been an interception of goods destined for high-risk countries where such goods were being 
transited through the VI. 
55 | P a g e  
 
 
In 2021 jewellery originating from Israel was imported from the US to the VI seven times being 
carried by a passenger on a ferry with US customs declarations forms. Other goods originating 
from Pakistan were imported through the airport. HMC reviewed these matters and confirmed 
there was no link to TF. In relation to the movement of precious metals, the route used appeared 
to be from the USA to VI onwards to St. Martin. There was no suspected link to TF. Neither 
the FCU nor the FIA-AIU had received any intelligence from any source relating to the 
movement of precious metals or stones for the purposes of TF. As such, the RVIPF FCU has 
conducted no investigations in relation to the movement of PMS. In relation to the movement 
or smuggling of goods including cash, BNIs and PMS The RVIPF IU received no information 
or intelligence relating to TF. Furthermore, there was no intelligence in relation to significant 
links to Tier 1 or Tier 2 countries or TF or terrorism. No vessels were registered to a legal 
owner in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 country or had any links to terrorism or TF. 
 
Therefore, in relation to the movement of goods and the movement of PMS there has been no 
suspicion of, or information in relation to, TF

No products or services were identified in relation to the use of the HVGD sector to facilitate 
TF. Wire transfer, cheques and bank financing are the main methods of payment used by 
HVGD.  
 
Between the years 2021- 2023, no SARs were filed by the HVGD sector which is not 
commensurate with its risk.  
 
In 2024, the FIA-SEU conducted an onsite inspection on two HVGD for the period 2021 – 
2023. Each entity received a rating of partially compliant with the requirement to undertake 
appropriate and adequate risk-based CDD and ECDD measures. This was due deficiencies in 
the conduct of their institutional / customer risk assessment and their ability to accurately 
identify risk and apply the appropriate mitigating measures. Additionally, the AML/CFT 
policies and procedure were in place, but were not risk-based and tailored to the risks of the 
entities due to the deficiencies identified in institutional / customer risk assessment. However, 
there are general measures such as screening and reporting in place to mitigate TF risk. 
Therefore, most of the entities have a general understanding of their AML/CFT obligations, 
but further training and guidance are required to foster better understanding of their AML/CFT 
obligations and risks. Training in AML / CFT was also generic. 
 
Most of the HVGD that engage in the relevant activities are registered with the FIA. New 
entities apply to the Ministry of Trade frequently and the FIA-SEU polices the perimeter. There 
are no barriers to the sharing of information with the private sector. The FIA-SEU provides 
guidance and training to the HVGD Sector and communicates effectively via email and 
telephone. The FIA-SEU sends sanctions listings upon receipt to the HVGD sector.

variables such as, inter alia, the value of income/revenue, scale of operations, level of 
accountability required by funding sources, level of verifiability of fund-raising methods and 
level of cash transfers were considered. The VI engaged with the financial sector to fully 
understand the NPO sector, to determine the level of TF risk based on their financial activities

and to reduce the occurrence of de-risking, where necessary. A total of 95 NPOs and 7 banks 
actively participated in this assessment by completing and submitting a RA questionnaire.  
 
For the period 2023, there were 121 registered NPOs in the VI which provided religious, 
charitable, social, environmental, educational, health, cultural, sports and animal welfare 
services.85 96% of the NPOs fell under the FATF definition of NPOs while 4% of the NPOs 
are deemed as non FATF NPOs.

In 2023, the NPO sector generated a significant annual revenue of $38,001,984.35 million 
(USD). It was noted that the majority of the NPOs estimated annual income/revenue was under 
$50,000. However, 6 NPOs had a gross annual income/revenue of over $1,000,000. These are 
 
85 The NPO Risk Assessment also highlighted that the significance of NPOs should not be overlooked as they 
contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of the VI particularly in a period of unprecedented 
natural disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria which caused widespread destruction across the British Virgin 
Islands in 2017.

purposes such as charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social or fraternal purposes, or for the carrying out

larger NPOs with international affiliations and donorship mainly from the US and the UK from 
reputable International Organisations. 
 
Approximately 78% of the NPOs in VI are predominantly domestic in nature in that funds are 
raised and disbursed locally, while 22% engaged in cross-border activities such as the raising 
or disbursing of funds internationally. However, most of these activities are conducted 
predominantly in jurisdictions such as the US, UK, Europe and the Caribbean region. Twenty-
six NPOs indicated that they received funds / donations from international organisations/ 
bodies. The largest cross-border funding was received by charitable and environmental NPOs: 
(a) from jurisdictions such as the UK and the US, which have been found to comply with the 
FATF standards through the implementation of various CFT legislation, policies and 
procedures87 (b) mainly from reputable and known organisations; and (c) for projects and 
development in the VI and not transmitted or distributed internationally88 which significantly 
reduces the TF risk given the lack of domestic terrorism in the VI. 
 
Twenty-seven NPOs indicated that they disburse funds internationally (a) to jurisdictions such 
as the US, UK, Norway, Anguilla, St. Vincent, Ghana and Dominica, which have been found 
to comply with the FATF standards through the implementation of various CFT legislation, 
policies and procedures and do not present a high risk 89  (b) to reputable international 
organisations; and (c) the largest distribution was mainly for project procurement purposes 
such as equipment and services from international vendors in US and Canada. Although the 
disbursement of funds for humanitarian purposes presents a level of TF risk, based on the data 
collected, only a few NPOs provide humanitarian assistance internationally, which is mainly 
provided to low-risk jurisdictions in times of natural disasters and destitution, and rarely in 
areas with a high level of TF risk exposure. 
 
Based on this analysis, it was concluded that FATF NPOs engaging in service activities are 
deemed most “at risk” for TF in the VI due to their level of cross border activities and foreign

affiliation and control. Four service focused NPOs in the VI were assessed as high risk for TF 
due to their cross-border activities, affiliation and control in connection with high-risk 
jurisdictions. While there exist inherent vulnerabilities within the NPO sector and deficiencies 
in the legislative framework, the overall inherent risk is assessed as low due to the low level of 
TF threat and abuse.  
3.4 The Vulnerability of Legal Persons and arrangements to Terrorist Financing in the 
Virgin Islands 
Utilising the targeted risk assessment of LPLAs conducted in the VI in 2024, the findings were 
used to determine the vulnerability rating of LPLAs to TF in the VI.  The TF high risk 
jurisdiction list confirmed by the TF WG was utilised in assessing the TF risk of the LPLAs to 
ensure consistency. It found that the highest vulnerability was posed by BVIBCs limited by 
shares (Medium-High), which constitute the overwhelming majority of LPLAs in the 
jurisdiction. In addition, BVIBCs limited by shares have by far the highest number of corporate 
directors. Legal persons, including limited partnerships, can have bodies corporate as their 
shareholders or, in the case of partnerships, their partners. These shareholders or partners can 
be from any jurisdiction in the world. These features increase the potential for opacity and 
dissimulation of BO thereby increasing the vulnerability of these legal persons to being 
misused for financial crime. There are 14,757 PEPs who are a BO of a legal person.90 In 
addition, one PEP can be a BO for more than one entity. As such, the data shows that 
approximately 4% of legal persons have a BO that is a PEP.

90 While, this data is not broken out by type of legal person, this is not seen as a large data gap given that BVIBCs 
make up over 97% of all the legal persons in the VI.

Data gaps about the nature of business carried out by VI legal persons remain, as the 
information captured in the current li TCSPs’ annual return is very general.  Requiring legal 
persons themselves to notify the Registrar of Corporate Affairs (ROCA) of their nature of 
business could yield more information. As a result, legal persons, other than foreign companies 
(low) and PTCs (Medium-Low), score Medium-High on this factor for TF.  The LPLA RA 
found that 7% of legal persons have BOs in a high-risk jurisdiction for TF. Legal arrangements 
were found to be vulnerable to misuse due to the size of the sector and the links to high-risk 
jurisdictions for TF and the overall vulnerability was Medium-High.

The ease with which a legal person can be set up may increase the vulnerability to misuse of 
legal persons in a jurisdiction. In the VI, all types of legal persons can be incorporated within 
24 hours. Regulatory requirements that legal persons must comply with at the time of 
incorporation include, for example having minimum capital, a minimum number of 
shareholders, having a VI resident director or a minimum number of directors. Only PTCs have

a more difficult set up process, as they must appoint a Class I trust license holder, in the VI 
refers to the highest level of TCSP license category, as its registered agent. All legal persons 
are incorporated via a TCSP. Moreover, the ability to establish a legal person is advertised 
internationally. Given these features, all types of legal persons except PTCs are rated as highly 
vulnerable on this factor and PTCs are rated as Medium-High.  
The overall vulnerability score was Medium-High for all LPLAs except for PTCs and foreign 
companies. As above, given the small materiality of these two sub-sectors in comparison with 
BIVBCs limited by shares, the MH rating was used in this RA.  
3.5 The Vulnerability of the Use of Cash and Bearer Negotiated Instruments in the 
Jurisdiction 
The other area that was considered in terms of vulnerability to the VI was the use of Cash and 
BNIs. Given that the VI is generally a cash-based society, the risk of cash being misused for 
the purposes of TF was considered by assessing the frequency of the use of cash within the 
regulated sectors, cash seizures by law enforcement within the jurisdiction and at its borders 
and intelligence relating to the misuse of cash. This was then considered in terms of any 
potential vulnerability to TF. 
 
Although the use of credit and debit cards for payments is becoming increasingly common as 
most businesses now have the ability to provide for such payment methods cash is still 
preferred. Particularly by smaller businesses where the number and/or value of daily 
transactions may not make it economically feasible to justify the processing fees associated 
with the use of debit and credit cards.     
 
The total amount of cash seized by authorities in the VI both for failure to declare and for cash 
found in relation to criminal conduct is depicted in the table below. None of these matters had 
any nexus to TF.

Although substantial amounts of cash were seized over the specified years, indicative of 
potential proceeds of crime and money laundering activities, there is no indication that the cash 
seized is connected to TF. 
 
Cash Based Businesses were defined as barber shops, hair and beauty salons, bus and tax 
services, car rental businesses, car wash businesses, laundromat and dry cleaners, jewellery 
stores, motor vehicle dealerships and nail salons. The total number of trade licences issued by 
the Department of Trade to these business types was 2684. Intelligence suggests that these 
businesses may be more susceptible to the facilitation of ML.  However, no TF-related 
disseminations were made to the FCU as it relates to these businesses. These cash based small 
businesses are owned by Virgin Islanders and expatriates alike, for example, car and boat 
rentals, restaurants, car washes, beauty salons, mini supermarkets, and clothing stores are 
owned by Virgin Islanders and expatriates alike. While some of the owners are originally from 
high-risk jurisdictions such as Lebanon and Palestine, there is no evidence to suggest that cash 
earned through these businesses has been misused to facilitate TF.   
 
No cash was seized from any cash intensive businesses. The total amount of cash seized overall 
for the relevant period was 3, 302,795 by RVIPF and $1,205,310 by HMC. None of which was 
found to have any link to terrorism or TF. In relation to cash coming in from higher risk 
countries the total noted by HMC was $78.646, none of which had any link to terrorism or TF. 
No cash was sent out to higher risk countries. The FIA-AIU indicated there was one SAR 
potentially linked to 4.46 million in cash which was categorised as ‘terrorism’ or ‘TF’. This 
related to a Tier 1 country. This matter was disclosed to the FCU and is under investigation.

Within the financial services sector, banking and MSBs licencees are considered the most cash-
intensive business as these entities are the primary recipients of the cash generated by the wider 
economy. However, based on the services provided by these sectors the risk of misuse for TF 
is low. In banking cash is primarily limited to the receipt of deposits from individual account 
holders.  Banks themselves have indicated that their preferred method to receive payments is 
through direct debit from a customer’s account or via cheque or wire transfer.  Verification of 
source of funds is conducted on over-threshold transactions.  In some institutions the over-
threshold limit requiring enquiry into source of funds and source of wealth is lower than the 
statutory limit of $10,000.  Between 2020 and 2023 less than 4% of payments received were 
cash based. 
 
Generally, the cash-intensive nature of the MSB sector, and the size of the annual value of 
outgoing and incoming transactions are factors that may impact the level of TF risk within the 
sector. In the VI outward money transfers constitute the greatest number of transactions 
recorded, accounting for 87% of all transactions at the end of 2023 valued at approximately 
$46.66 million.  The average value of outgoing transactions is $569.25. Conversely incoming 
transfers were valued at $6.89 million at the end of 2023 or roughly 13% of all transactions.  
The average value of incoming transactions is $857.00. Given the demographic composition 
of the Territory, this imbalance between incoming and outgoing transfers is not unexpected.  
The use of cash for payment of services to MSBs varies, and averages approximately 13% of 
payments received, while cheques and credit/debit card payments account for approximately 
63% and 14% respectively. While the use of cash within the MSB sector varies, money 
transfers to and from Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions constitute less than 6% of total transfers.   
 
The use of cash for payment of services to insurers is limited, however, cash is widely accepted 
amongst intermediaries, being the preferred method to receive payments for services provided 
to clients.  The percentage of total payments received via cash by intermediaries represents 
approximately 23%, with cheques, wire transfers and credit card payments making up 77%.  
Cash transaction limits for payment of services range between $2,000 and 15,000.  The risk of 
TF is low in the insurance sector.  
 
Use of cash in the IB sector and the IP sector is limited as payments for services are made 
primarily by way of wire transfer. In relation to Financing, use of cash is also limited as 
payment for services received is primarily via wire transfer or cheque.  Where cash is accepted, 
65 | P a g e  
 
the maximum amount is $10,000 in accordance with the AMLTFCOP and represents only 13% 
of all payments for those entities. Cash is not accepted within the VASP sector given the virtual 
nature of the business.  Financial transactions are executed primarily via wire transfer and VAs. 
Use of cash is also limited in the TCSP sector.  The preferred method of payment for most 
entities is either cheque or wire transfer, with some entities also accepting credit/debit cards.  
Most licencees do not accept cash as payment for services but where cash is accepted, the 
maximum amount accepted may range from $1000 to $5000.  Between 2020 and 2023, no 
entity accepted more than 10% of their total payment in the form of cash, with the average 
being approximately 3%. 
 
Wire transfers and cheques are the main methods of payment for accountants, lawyers and 
notaries.   
Limited cash and cheque payments are accepted.  Wire transfers, cheques, cash and bank 
financing are the main payment methods accepted by the real estate sector; the use of cash is 
limited. Within the relevant legislation, namely the AMLRs, there is a 15,000 threshold which 
ensures that CDD measures are applied when conducting cash transactions in the DPMS sector 
and the HVGDs sector. Debit and credit cards, cheques and cash are the main payment methods 
accepted by the DPMS Sector. For the HVGDs wire transfer, cheques and bank financing are 
the main methods of payment used. 
 
The overall vulnerability of cash being misused for the purposes of terrorism or TF in the VI 
is low. 
3.6 Emerging Risks - Vulnerabilities 
Additionally, emerging risks related to financial services business were considered such as new 
and emerging types of VASPs, Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and token issuance, stablecoins and 
off chain transactions. 
 
A review of open-source material as well as cases under investigation by the RVIPF revealed 
an emerging risk for VASPs in terms of TF and TFS evasion, as those engaged in these 
activities take advantage of the lack of consistent regulation globally, ease of obscuring virtual 
transactions and rapidly evolving technology. Fundraising campaigns allegedly for charitable 
purposes, crowdfunding and social media campaigns accepting cryptocurrency have been 
66 | P a g e  
 
identified within the materials found92. These tend to be relatively small campaigns involving 
simpler methods and lower amounts of funds and is an appealing method of fundraising for 
terrorism financiers given the difficulties for investigators in distinguishing between genuine 
humanitarian causes in areas where there is known terrorist activity, and terrorist funding 
schemes. Recent prosecutions globally of donors have slightly inhibited this type of funding 
and led some groups to stop soliciting cryptocurrency donations, but it remains widespread.  
 
VAs are known to be used by terrorist groups, in particular by ISIL in Asia and groups in Syria 
and terrorist groups that are using VAs often use stablecoins and experiment with anonymity 
enhancing cryptocurrencies.  VAs have been identified by FATF as being particularly capable 
of undermining regulatory controls when they involve person-to-person transfers, with no 
regulated intermediary and no clear jurisdictional boundaries to the transaction93. The use of 
Stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) in particular, has been noted94. Self-hosted wallets and peer 
to peer transactions are emerging as an area where risks are not yet fully evaluated and therefore 
not sufficiently mitigated, making them vulnerable to misuse95. Non-Fungible tokens are not 
approached consistently across jurisdictions and have been found to be used in fraud and other 
financial crimes, as well as money laundering schemes, but less so with regard to proliferation 
or TF96.  
 
Perhaps the biggest threat from a TF perspective is the convergence of traditional fundraising 
methods with technology enabled fundraising. The use of multiple communication networks, 
social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, person to person transactions, and other virtual asset 
services in conjunction with traditional methods of movement through conventional financial 
systems means that the financial trail is more complex, convoluted and challenging to follow.

Service Providers  
67 | P a g e  
 
This is likely to be appealing to terrorist organisations and those subject to sanctions looking 
to move funds illicitly and with access to multiple methods of doing so.   
 
The evolution of the governance of LPLAs, for example using decentralised models of 
governance or organisation, poses challenges with identifying the persons in control of a legal 
person or arrangement. However, in the VI this cannot be done utilising a VI legal person.97 
To date, new governance models have primarily been used in the virtual asset industry and 
have been known by the name “decentralised autonomous organisation.”   The use of 
decentralised finance (DeFi) has been noted and presents issues in terms of identifying the 
controlling entity or person and the jurisdiction where they are operating, which makes DeFi 
arrangements appealing to those wishing to move funds for illicit purposes98. 
 
The European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2024 noted that Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) has also been embraced by some supporters of terrorism and violent 
extremism, who have integrated the use of generative AI and LLMs into their propaganda 
toolbox. Some right-wing actors are able to accelerate the spread of disinformation and hate 
speech online through the effective use of AI. Recent examples in the right-wing scene have 
involved AI-generated propaganda material and deepfakes containing racist or anti-Semitic 
messages or attempting to bypass an AI model's ethical safeguards and spread prohibited 
information through coded effects applied to seemingly irrelevant content. As deepfakes can 
alter videos in real time, there is a growing concern that livestreaming deepfakes could be used 
for terrorist purposes in the future to spread social alarm. AI has also been used to create fake 
identities and automated bots to manage chat groups.  
 
Technology is also used to shield communications and activities from detection. In addition to 
periodic device formatting, freely accessible E2EE applications, VPNs, the dark web and 
cryptographic applications are commonly used to enhance the privacy of communications. 
With the development of immersive technology, training camps could be offered in realistic, 
(re-)created virtual environments and scenarios, as in the metaverse, which has already been 
used by young individuals in the jihadist milieu to simulate attacks. Investigations across 
 
97 As the legislation prohibits this although the vulnerability remains for group of legal persons / legal 
arrangements.

Member States show a stable use of cryptocurrencies as a means of transfer for TF. However, 
a shift away from the use of Bitcoin towards stablecoins was observed. 99 
 
As at the date of this report, geopolitical risks are rapidly changing and closer relationships 
between high-risk countries, for example North Korea, Iran and Russia, can forge new 
pathways for these countries to launder money, finance terrorism and proliferation and evade 
sanctions by establishing complex structures of LPLAs, including in countries that may not 
traditionally be seen as high-risk countries.   
 
This matter will remain under review including by the CLEA policy of reviewing and 
disseminating quarterly TF risks and trends updates. 
3.7 National Vulnerability 
The National level vulnerability for TF was ML, based on a finding of ML for structural 
vulnerabilities, ML for the legal and regulatory framework and MH for the effectiveness of the 
framework primarily due to the impediments in the resourcing of law enforcement and the 
consequential limitations on the progression of matters relating to TF particularly as it relates 
to the misuse of legal persons and the transfer of VAs, which require particular skills, expertise 
and human and technical resources. 
3.7.1 Structural Vulnerabilities 
In relation to the structural elements, namely the rule of law, the national counter terrorism 
strategy, the national TF strategy and the engagement with counter parties on TF and terrorism, 
the overall vulnerability was rated as Medium-Low. The VI adheres to the rule of law with a 
democratically elected House of Assembly, a Governor who is responsible for law enforcement 
and matters of defence, and an independent and impartial judiciary. The National Counter 
Terrorism Strategy was implemented in 2022, and the National AML CFT Policy and Strategy 
were updated in in 2024. A national TF investigation and prosecution strategy was also being 
worked on by the authorities at the time of this report. Collaboration and cooperation with 
foreign counterparts in relation to financial crime generally and including TF specifically has 
increased since the MER with a marked increase in the use of outgoing requests by the FIA-
AIU and other LEAs.

69 | P a g e  
 
3.7.2 The Legal and Regulatory Framework as it Relates to Terrorist Financing – 
Compliance with International Standards 
In relation to compliance with international standards regarding laws and regulations, as these 
relate to terrorism, TF, preventative measures, BO, cash couriers, the responsibilities and 
powers of law enforcement and investigative authorities as well as international cooperation 
the overall rating in terms of the vulnerability of the jurisdiction was ML.  
 
As the VI had very recently undergone a Mutual Evaluation (published in 2024), this provided 
a useful starting point for an objective assessment of the level of compliance within the 
Territory. Additionally, consideration was given to the efforts made since the Mutual 
Evaluation to further enhance the legislative framework, as well as the vast amount of policy 
work undertaken. 
 
Recommendation 5, which relates to the TF framework in the VI was rated Compliant, the WG 
was therefore satisfied that there were no significant issues to address in this regard. In relation 
to Recommendation 6 and the TFS requirements, all of these measures have either been 
addressed or in the final stages of being addressed, it is therefore concluded that this 
recommendation is satisfactorily addressed. 
 
In relation to the misuse of LPLAs for TF, the requirements of recommendation 24 
(transparency of legal persons) were reviewed by the WG as this is relevant as to whether 
adequate and accurate BO information can be obtained by law enforcement in relation to 
investigations into legal persons. Recommendation 24 was rated PC, however since that time 
a targeted RA of LPs and LAs has been concluded. The BVI Business and Limited Partnerships 
are now required to maintain the BO information,  the Registered Agent must verify this similar 
to the agent’s obligation under AMLTFCOP. Requirements on foreign companies’ registered 
offices to include country of incorporation information have also been included. The Trustee 
Act has also been amended to ensure that there is a requirement to collect, keep and maintain 
adequate, accurate and up to date information on BO. Furthermore, requirements have been 
imposed relating to liquidators. Additionally in 2024 the VI was in the process of implementing 
a BO register to ensure all information on BO is maintained by a public authority and verified100. 
 
100 This was implemented and came into effect on 2 January 2025. 
70 | P a g e  
 
Therefore, accurate and adequate information must now be held, and this strengthens the 
regime and further mitigates against the risk of abuse of companies for TF purposes.  
 
Additionally, in order to review the VI’s framework in relation to supervision of FIs and 
DNFBPs and how this may impact TF, as well as the powers of Law Enforcement and the 
international cooperation framework deficiencies in relation to Recommendations 10,11, 12, 
17 and 15, 30, 31, 27 and 40 were considered as well as the VI’s progress in addressing 
deficiencies and again it was concluded that no substantial deficiencies remain. 
3.7.3 The Effectiveness of Measures to Prevent and Detect Terrorist Financing – 
Compliance with International Standards 
In relation to the effectiveness of the jurisdiction in preventing and detecting TF, the evasion 
of TFS, the misuse of LPLAs, the sharing of information and international cooperation, as well 
as the use of financial intelligence. Again, the VI’s MER provided a useful starting point in 
terms of an objective assessment of the level of effectiveness.  
 
Additionally, the progress made since the conclusion of the Mutual Evaluation and 
improvements made to the CFT regime since that time have been considered, including in 
relation to resources, policies, training and the increased cooperation at the national level. The 
overall vulnerability score in relation to the effectiveness of the VI as it relates to combatting 
TF was MH. 
 
Within the MER Immediate Outcome 9 (TF) was rated Moderate. Recommended Actions 
related to increasing training and the implementation of a national strategy relating to 
investigations and prosecutions. The ODPP has implemented a policy regarding prosecutions 
and the overall cross agency strategy is being finalised. A system has also been implemented 
to monitor TF risks and disseminate identified trends. Funding has also been granted for 
additional financial investigators at the RVIPF-FCU although these are not yet in place.  
Further enhancements are still in progress in relation to resources and the progression of 
investigations into prosecutions.  
 
In relation to Immediate Outcome 10 recommendations related to improving oversight of 
implementation of TFS obligations by reporting entities and increasing risk understanding. The 
71 | P a g e  
 
FSC’s approved 2024 Inspection schedule calls for the conduct of 50 compliance inspections 
based on inherent ML/TF/PF risks and supervisory concerns identified, 20 of which include a 
focus on TFS. Those twenty entities consist of TCSPs and IBs, as these sectors have been 
identified as posing a higher risk. The assessment includes a review of entities’ TFS policies 
and procedures for ongoing monitoring, sanctions identification, screening, and reporting, and 
also considers sanctions training, and entities’ overall testing of the efficacy of their sanctions 
framework. The inspections also assess the level of implementation and effectiveness of the 
entities TFS framework through sample testing of client files. Such sample testing aims to 
gauge the level of compliance as it relates to screening of BOs against relevant sanction lists 
(inclusive of appropriateness of screening and frequency) as well as the level of ongoing 
monitoring/ reporting (where applicable). 
  
In addition to the onsite inspection programme, the FSC is conducting a desk-based review of 
30 TCSPs, 10 of which are scheduled to have their sanctions procedures reviewed.  These 
reviews will include a review of the effectiveness of the systems in place for such monitoring 
and the level of training provided to staff. Once complete, the results of these reviews will feed 
into supervisory risk models. The thematic review had been completed in Q4 2024 and at the 
time of the RA consideration was being given to remedial and enforcement actions.  
 
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unprecedented growth of sanctions, the GO 
in response to the increased workload recruited an additional member of staff for a six-month 
period up until May 2023. The GO has undertaken Sanctions specific training between 2020 
and 2023 including a 5 day training session on investigating financial crime including sanctions, 
maritime sanctions, proliferation financing, licencing and reporting to OFSI, processing 
sanctions applications, sanctions workshop including regulatory developments, risk typologies 
and corporate transparency issues, the Overseas Territories Sanctions Forum, sessions hosted 
by HMT and OFSI on sanctions, trusts, ownership and control, oligarchs, information sharing 
and the designations of individuals at the country level. In 2024 the sanctions function was 
delegated from the GO to the Sanctions Unit, led by the Sanctions Coordinator sitting in the 
AGC. 
 
The Sanctions Unit is now comprised of the Sanctions Coordinator, a Policy Officer and a Data 
Specialist. A Licencing Specialist from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development 
Office (FCDO) has been seconded to the Unit to assist in the functions of licencing primarily 
72 | P a g e  
 
and other functions as delegated. This specialist will serve until July 2025. It is intended that 
in the coming months the Unit will be staffed with a further policy officer and administration 
personnel. The FCDO, in supporting the capacity building of the VI in sanctions compliance, 
has facilitated the enrollment of 16 persons across various Government Agencies and Statutory 
Bodies on the ACAMS Certified Global Sanctions Specialist Course. The Sanctions 
Coordinator is currently enrolled, as well as personnel from FSC, FIA, British Virgin Islands 
Ports Authority, AGC, VI Shipping and Maritime Authority and HMC. It is envisaged that, on 
successful completion of the courses by these students, the VI’s mandate as it pertains to 
sanctions implementation and enforcement will be better understood and executed. The Global 
Economic Sanctions C5 workshops and conference in November 2024 was attended by the 
Sanctions Coordinator and other personnel from the AGC and FIA and provided an opportunity 
for networking with other Jurisdictions on sanctions matters, trends and risks. Also in 
November 2024, FCDO, in collaboration with OFSI, delivered a one-day workshop. New staff 
are required to undertake courses where they do not already possess the relevant certificates. 
 
The Sanctions Committee is a subcommittee of the CCA. After operating as an ad hoc 
committee since 2019, the Sanctions Committee was formally established on 26 June 2024 
with specific terms of reference. Core members of the Sanctions Committee are the Sanctions 
Coordinator (as Chairman), the AGC, FIA, FSC and RVIPF (FCU). Associate membership 
extends to VI Shipping Registry, Department of Immigration, HMC, International Tax 
Authority, BVI Ports Authority, BVI Airports Authority, Ministry of Finance, Civil Aviation 
Authority and ODPP. There is also provision in the Terms of Reference for ex-officio members 
to attend meetings as needs be. The Sanctions Committee meets monthly.  
 
The Sanctions Committee provides an avenue for collaboration and cooperation, where 
sanction matters that require high level cooperation and coordination can be discussed, 
including reporting and updating on suspected sanctions breaches, discussing typologies and 
assessing risks, discussing media and other inquiries, as well as discussions on drafting and 
amendment of policy and procedural documents can take place. This will allow for greater 
efficiency and effectiveness in sanctions implementation, through shared understanding and 
input in the process by key agencies and/or departments.  
 
73 | P a g e  
 
In relation to IO5 and the transparency of LPLAs, much work has been done on understanding 
risks and raising awareness of the risk of misuse of VI legal persons to facilitate ML and TF in 
the VI and abroad. 
 
Further enhancements are still in progress in relation to resources and the progression of 
investigations into prosecutions. 
3.8 Overall Vulnerability Rating of Each Sector – Adjusting for National Vulnerability 
and Materiality. 
In relation to the overall vulnerability of the VI to TF, the WG considered the vulnerability of 
each sector and considered the findings regarding vulnerability at the national level as well as 
materiality and considered whether any adjustment was required.  
 
It is recognised that materiality plays a role in relation to inherent risk. Therefore, regulated 
sectors were ranked according to their materiality based on the number of entities in the sector, 
sectoral risk, assets under management or turnover, number of employees etc. Other areas 
reviewed above (legal persons, cash and NPOs) were also placed according to their materiality 
rating. Then any adjustments to the inherent risk rating based on materiality was considered. 
Those with lower materiality had their vulnerability scores reduced.

Controls  
5.1 
Private Sector Controls 
To consider the effect that identified controls had on the level of risk, first the private sectors’ 
implementation of controls was considered. Whilst these were considered to some extent in 
relation to the vulnerability caused by a high-level lack of controls at the national level, at the 
sectoral levels this involved consideration of the implementation of CDD and EDD measures 
including for BO (holding accurate and up-to-date information) by the private sector and the 
impact this had on mitigating the risk of TF. The extent to which entities were carrying out 
entity-level TFRAs and implementing corresponding, targeted controls was considered as well 
78 | P a g e  
 
as the quality of the suspicious transaction reports filed. The level of compliance with TFS was 
also a factor.  Employee training and knowledge relating to TF and TF risk were also 
considered. The level of compliance with these requirements was rated using results of onsite 
and offsite visits as well as the expertise of the supervisors and questionnaires sent out to 
industry.  
 
The Scoring table used for the rating of the compliance of entities was: 
 
• Good - Over 85% of entities fully compliant with requirement 
• Satisfactory - Between 70% and 85% fully compliant 
• Weak - Between 51% and 9 % fully compliant 
• Very weak - 50% or below compliance levels 
 
The results of the findings were analysed, and the weighting of the various factors was adjusted 
depending on their pertinence to the sector. This led to an overall control score for each sector 
of Good, Satisfactory, Weak or Very Weak. 
5.1.1 Banking 
FSC’s findings reveal a high level of compliance with CDD and EDD within the banking sector.  
Feedback received from other competent authorities such as ITA, AGC and RVIPF who 
request information from banks indicates that information has been provided in a timely 
manner. These authorities are more likely to request specific account information. FSC has not 
requested any such information during the period, However, due to a recent IC request, FSC 
recently sought banking information on behalf of a foreign regulator for VI entities believed to 
be holding bank accounts in the Territory.  The information requested, which consisted of 
account opening applications which included details of BO, bank statements and transaction 
listings and company extracts, was provided by the bank within the timeframe stipulated for 
responding.  This allowed the FSC to respond to the foreign regulator who provided feedback 
indicating that the information provided was useful to their investigation. Given the nature of 
the activities supervised by the FSC, this is consistent with what FSC expects.  
 
All banks licenced in the VI have conducted an institutional RA, which included an assessment 
of their TF risk.  These entities have considered their potential exposure to TF based on 
79 | P a g e  
 
information provided from open-source material and existing national TFRAs when designing 
their internal controls policies and procedures. In addition, most banks have completed a full 
TFRA with the remaining in the process of doing so.  
 
 The FSC’s review of SAR processes in banks found such practices satisfactory and 
commensurate with risk. Between 2020 to 2023, banks in the VI filed a total of 636 SARs, or 
roughly 5% of all SARs filed during that time. This sector ranks third for the number of SARs 
filed. Given the quality of information submitted, the high average of filing entities, and the 
relatively large number of SARs submitted, the overall quality is good. 
 
Based on a review of the compliance officer reports that must be submitted to the FSC on an 
annual basis as well as onsite inspections, relevant employees of all banking licensees have 
received TF training, including training on the identification of TF within the last 3 years. Due 
to the systemic importance to the Territory’s economy, all banks are monitored by the FSC’s 
SSU. Ongoing desk-based reviews by the SSU have found that risk mitigation policies and 
procedures that have been updated within the reporting period are in place in all entities and 
relevant controls have been implemented. In most banking institutions, all relevant staff are 
fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and understand how it 
impacts the work of the organisation as evidenced from training information provided through 
compliance officer reports and other returns that have been reviewed by the supervisor.   
 
Targeted Financial Sanctions Compliance –Inspection Results, Compliance with 
Requirements and Breaches:  
Two of the seven banks (29%) have been inspected within the past two years. All inspections 
for banks are full scope and encompass a TFS review and assessment. The licencee inspected 
in 2023 received a rating of Largely Compliant and the findings noted that the bank had 
established sanctions policies and procedures that were largely appropriate to ensure 
compliance with TFS obligations. Furthermore, the assessment revealed the licencees’ 
implementation of appropriate screening and monitoring procedures for all customers and 
transactions.   Through inquiry and sample testing, it was noted that there were no instances 
where a client during take-on or during the business relationship had any sanction exposure. 
The findings also indicated continuous measures to mitigate TFS risk through the Bank’s 
continuous sanctions training of staff, and continuous testing of its TFS procedures and systems. 
It is expected that all seven (7) banks will be inspected by the end of 2025.

5.1.2 Money Service Businesses 
FSC’s findings reveal a high level of compliance with CDD and EDD measures, which take 
into consideration BO information and ensure reliance on original documentation to verify 
individuals and key CDD information. Such controls also require BO information to be up-to-
date and valid. Two previous MSB inspections reveal a rating of largely compliant as it relates 
to CDD and verification. Shortcomings were identified with the application of EDD measures 
within one MSB, which received a rating of Partially Compliant for EDD. The other MSB 
inspection revealed only minor shortcomings relating to EDD, and a rating of Largely 
Compliant was assigned. 
 
100% of entities have carried out a TFRA during the reporting period and implemented all 
relevant controls in line with the findings of their TFRA. 
 
Based on a review of the compliance officer reports that must be submitted to the FSC on an 
annual basis, employees within the MSB sector have been trained in TF and the identification 
of TF within the last 3 years. Further entities have risk mitigation policies and procedures, 
updated within the data period, that specifically address TF risk. 
 
In 2022, one MSB underwent an onsite inspection which included a review of its TFS 
procedures. The findings of that inspection indicate that the licencee has established TFS 
procedures relating to screening, ongoing monitoring and reporting. The inspection did not 
identify any shortcomings with the MSB’s TFS framework. Furthermore, there were no 
81 | P a g e  
 
deficiencies arising from the sample testing of client files, which evidenced the incorporation 
of sanctions exposure within the client RA, and ongoing screening and monitoring of customers 
and transactions.  
 
Relevant staff of MSBs are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is 
exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisation as evidenced from 
training information provided through compliance officer reports and other returns that have 
been reviewed by the supervisor. 
 
During the reporting period only 2 SARs were filed by MSBs, which accounts for 0.02% of 
the total number of SARs filed during this period. Neither SAR was TF-related. The number 
of SARs filed appears low given the cash-intensive nature of the sector, however, the quality 
of information submitted is good. 
 
Table 28 – Money Service Businesses Sector Controls 
5.1.3 Insurance 
The desk-based reviews raised no issues surrounding the implementation of CDD/EDD within 
the insurance sector. 88% of entities have carried out a TFRA during the data period while 12% 
are currently working on completing a TFRA. 75% have implemented relevant controls in line 
with the findings of their TFRA, while 12.5% have implemented some controls based on the 
findings of their TFRA and another 12.5% have not implemented any controls based on any 
TFRA. 
 
Employees across the insurance sector have been trained in TF and the identification of TF 
within the last 3 years. 75% of licencees have risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated 
within the data period, that specifically address TF risk while 12.5% have risk mitigation

policies and procedures, updated during the data period that refer to and address TF risk to 
some extent. The remaining 12.5% do not have any risk mitigation policies and procedures that 
refer to and address TF risk. 
 
Given the identified low level of risk within the insurance sector, no inspections focused on 
TFS have been carried out within the insurance sector during the reporting period to ascertain 
the sector’s level of compliance with its sanctions obligations.  However, 52 licencees have 
been subject to desk-based reviews between 2022 and 2023. 
 
Relevant staff within 87% of licencees are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisation. In the 
remaining 13% most relevant staff are fully aware of TF Risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisation. 
 
A total of 25 SARs were submitted during the review period, accounting for 3% of all SARs 
submitted.  None of these were TF-related, given the low-risk nature of the insurance products 
offered by this sector, the level of filings is considered commensurate with overall sector risk.  
The quality of information submitted, however, is generally not considered to fully cover the 
threshold for a SAR, as a number of the SARs received were later categorised as UARs 
(unusual activity reports) by the FIA or not analysed rated as low because the information 
contained did not adequately describe a suspicion. Therefore, the resulting assessment aligned 
more with a satisfactory quality having regard to good quality in more than half of the SARs 
filed by this sector.

5.1.4 Investment Business 
Based on findings of inspections conducted between 2020 and 2022, the IB Sector has 
generally established CDD controls, requiring risk based CDD and verification of BOs (via the 
collection of accurate and up-to-date information). Inspection findings demonstrate a high level 
of implementation with CDD procedures, with 8 of the 11 IB licencees inspected (for CDD) 
receiving a rating of Largely Compliant or Compliant. There was, however, a decrease as it 
relates to the level of EDD conducted with 6 of the 11 licencees inspected demonstrating 
shortcomings in the implementation of EDD measures and receiving a rating of partially or 
non-compliant. For those licencees where deficiencies were identified, corrective actions were 
imposed which required full remediation. Such remediation requires the licencees to amend 
established controls and review their portfolios to ensure appropriate measures are applied. The 
corrective actions also require continuous reporting to the supervisory division until an 
appropriate level of effective compliance is attained. 
 
According to the annual AML Returns, 97 IBs have conducted an institutional RA, which 
included an assessment of their TF risk.  Based on this analysis and assessment, the FSC has 
determined that IBs should be reviewed to understand and address this risk. Therefore, thematic 
reviews assessing the conduct of institutional RAs (for ML and TF) and whether the sector 
understands its ML and TF risk have been included in the 2024 Inspection programme and will 
commence in the 4th quarter of 2024, through quarter 1 of 2025. While this assessment is still 
underway, the initial findings illustrate the conduct of Institutional RAs for 75% of the IB 
Licencees inspected. A review of the institutional RAs largely evidenced the consideration of 
both ML and TF risks.     
 
With respect to Asset and Investment Managers, 50% have carried out a TFRA during the data 
period, however, 25% have not. 12.5% have considered TF risk, but have not completed a full 
TFRA, while another 12.5% are currently working on a TFRA.  75% of licencees have 
implemented relevant controls in line with the findings of the TFRA and 25% have 
implemented some controls based on the findings of their TFRA. 50% of Asset Administrator 
licencees have carried out a TFRA during the data period and have implemented all relevant 
controls in line with the findings of their TFRA, while the other 50% are currently working on 
a TFRA. 
 
84 | P a g e  
 
60% of Brokers/Dealers have carried out a TFRA during the data period, while 20% have 
considered TF risk, but have not completed a full TFRA, and another 20% are currently 
working on a TFRA. 80% have implemented relevant controls in line with the findings of their 
TFRA or consideration of their TF risk while 20% have implemented some TF controls 
independent of a TFRA. The one licencee holding an exchange licence has carried out a TFRA 
during the data period and has implemented relevant controls in line with the findings of its 
TFRA. 
 
All relevant employees in 87.5% of the Asset and Investment Manager entities have been 
trained on TF and the identification of TF within the last 3 years, while 12.5% of licencees 
have had most of their employees trained on TF and the identification of TF within the last 3 
years. In relation to Asset Administrators, all relevant employees across the sector have been 
trained in TF and the identification of TF within the last 3 years, as have all relevant employees 
across the Broker/Dealer sector and Exchange sector. 
 
62.5% of Asset and Investment Manager licencees have risk mitigation policies and procedures, 
updated within the data period, that specifically address TF risk. The remaining 37.5% have 
risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated during the data period that refer to and address 
TF risk to some extent. 50% of Asset Administrator licencees have risk mitigation policies and 
procedures, updated within the data period, that specifically address TF risk, while 50%have 
risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated during the data period that refer to and address 
TF risk to some extent. 
 
In relation to Broker/Dealers 40% of the licencees have risk mitigation policies and procedures, 
updated within the data period, that specifically address TF risk, while 60% have risk 
mitigation policies and procedures, updated during the data period that refer to and address TF 
risk to some extent. The Exchange licencee has risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated 
within the data period, that specifically address TF risk. 
 
In relation to Asset and Investment Managers, in 87.5% of licencees, all relevant staff are fully 
aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and understand how it 
impacts the work of their organisations.  In 12.5% of licencees most relevant staff are fully 
aware of TF Risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and understand how it 
impacts the work of their organisation. For Asset Administrators, all relevant staff are fully 
85 | P a g e  
 
aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and understand how it 
impacts the work of their organisations. As regards brokers/dealers, all relevant staff in 60% 
of licencees are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and 
understand how it impacts the work of their organisations, while most relevant staff in 20% of 
licencees are fully aware of TF Risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and 
understand how it impacts the work of their organisation. Finally, in relation to exchanges all 
relevant staff within the licencee are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisations. 
 
Between 2020 and 2023, 115 SARs were received, which accounts for only 0.93% of total 
SARs filed, none of which were TF-related.  Given the size of the IB sector, both the number 
of entities filing SARs and the number of SARs filed during the reporting period appears low.   
 
With respect to quality, most SARs received from this sector were considered to be poor and 
subsequently reclassified as UARs or low-priority by the FIA, because the information received 
did not meet the threshold to constitute a SAR.

5.1.5 Financing 
Regarding the implementation of CDD/EDD measures, no issues have been identified 
including in the collection of BO information. The clientele in this sector is very localised and 
limited to small transactions. 50% of entities have carried out a TFRA during the reporting 
period and implemented all relevant controls in line with the findings of their TFRA.  50% of 
entities have not carried out a TFRA and have therefore not implemented any controls 
specifically based on any TFRA.

5.1.6 Virtual Asset Service Providers 
As part of the application process, the FSC has reviewed the technological systems including 
AML/CFT obligations via live demonstrations. Firms who offer solely to institutional clients 
have been more readily able to demonstrate compliance with the AML/CFT regime. The FSC 
reviews the VASPs' policies and procedures to ensure they include effective mechanisms for 
collecting, verifying, and securely transmitting required information about both the sender and 
recipient of virtual asset transfers. The FSC also assesses the functionality of VASPs' 
transaction monitoring systems to ensure they can detect and flag non-compliant transactions.  
 
In relation to established VASPs, 22 were compliant or largely compliant with AML / CFT 
requirements, 19 were partially compliant and 4 were non-compliant. In relation to startups, 5 
were compliant or largely compliant, 3 were partly compliant and 2 were non-compliant.  
Deficiencies identified include sanctions screenings, adequate KYC procedures and failure to 
implement travel rule requirements (as required).  
87 | P a g e  
 
In large part the VASP applicants have been able to demonstrate that they have AML/CFT 
procedures104 and controls in place. Where procedures were not in place for a minute number 
of applicants at the onset of submissions, they have since been able to demonstrate that they 
have adapted the necessary AML/CTF policies and controls. 
 
A summary of these concerns has also been presented to the industry during various outreach 
activities, with the goal of assisting future applicants in submitting complete and 
comprehensive applications and providing clarifying information regarding regulatory 
requirements and expectations.  Some of the issues identified include adequacy of 
AML/CFT policies and procedures that are not bespoke to VI legislative and regulatory 
requirements to ensure adequate sanction screening mechanisms at the onboarding phase and 
on a continuous basis.  
 
The FSC has conducted a gap analysis on each applicant and where deficiencies have been 
identified applicants have been engaged to make corrective action prior to consideration of 
approval.   Outsourcing Risk was also an identified area of concern whereby VASP applicants 
outsource certain AML/CFT functions to group-related parties and/or non-group-related 
parties. This primarily relates to client onboarding, continuous monitoring and sanction 
screening. Identified deficiencies in applicants’ policies around outsourcing include no 
procedures for assurance testing, lack of continuity of function (where for example the 
outsourcing arrangement came to an immediate halt) and no clear effective system to ensure 
sufficient oversight of the outsourced activities as required by VI legislation. Lack of service 
level agreements was also an issue, primarily where group entities were contracted. 
Compliance with the application of the Travel Rule Compliance was also a concern as in some 
instances, applicants were unable to demonstrate that they have addressed measures and 
procedures which must be undertaken, where that VASP or intermediary service provider may 
be located in countries that do not have commensurate travel rules requirements. The FSC has 
 
104 Applicants are required to demonstrate their ability to comply with the VI’s AML/CFT framework since 
December 2022. The scope of the requirements includes the ability to demonstrate that they have established and 
maintain procedures that screen and verify the identity of clients. The applicants are also required to prove their 
policies and procedures are effective. Applicants must demonstrate that they have adopted a risk-based approach 
to identifying risk and for the monitoring of financial activity, including compliance with sanction orders. 
Additionally, applicants must be able to demonstrate that they have appropriate policies to comply with the travel 
rule. This includes providing evidence that said compliance has been in effect since December 2022. As a measure 
of this, all applicants are subjected to a VASP pre-authorisation questionnaire. The assessment is specific to each 
applicants’ activities and resulting risk and helps to inform its AML risk assessment.  
88 | P a g e  
 
also noted that some policies are broad and do not prescribe specific compliance requirements 
such as the collection of wallet addresses for each relevant transaction.  
 
In relation to entities carrying out entity-level TFRA and implementing corresponding, targeted 
controls: 
24% of entities are currently working on a TFRA, while 68% have carried out a TFRA during 
the data period, and 8% have considered TF risk but have not completed a full TFRA. 62% of 
entities have implemented all relevant controls in line with the findings of their TFRA. 12% 
have implemented some controls based on the findings of our TFRA and 18% have 
implemented some TF controls independent of a TFRA. 8% of entities have not implemented 
any controls based on any TFRA. 
 
79% of entities have risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated within the data period, 
that specifically address TF risk. 12% have risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated 
during the data period that refer to and address TF risk to some extent, while 6% have risk 
mitigation policies and procedures that cover TF to some extent but have not been updated 
during the data period.105 
 
As part of the application process, some VASP applicants outsource certain AML/CFT 
functions to group-related parties and/or non-group related parties. This primarily relates to 
client onboarding, continuous monitoring, and sanction screening. Identified deficiencies in 
applicants’ policies around outsourcing include no procedures for assurance testing, lack of 
continuity of function (where for example the outsourcing arrangement came to an immediate 
halt) and no clear effective system to ensure sufficient oversight of the outsourced activities as 
required by VI legislation. Lack of service level agreements also was an issue primarily where 
group entities were contracted. 
 
 In 79% of entities all employees have been trained on TF and the identification of TF within 
the last 3 years. In 15% of the entities, it is most employees who have been so trained.  In 6% 
of the entities, most employees have not been trained in TF and the identification of TF within 
the last 3 years.106

In 85% of entities all relevant staff are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisation.  In 12% of 
entities most relevant staff are fully aware of TF Risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is 
exposed and understand how it impacts the work of their organisation. In 3% of entities, 
however, only some staff are aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed 
and understand how it impacts their organisation and sector.107 
 
87.5% of all SARs received by the FIA during the reporting period were filed by VASPs. 
Eighty-eight of these SARs were TF-related. However, the majority of SARs received by this 
sector were submitted by one BVIBC acting as a VASP. The quality of SARs received from 
one VASP that is responsible for a large number of SARs filed has been found lacking due to 
inaccurate reporting, transaction date discrepancies, misleading narration, and lack of suspicion 
explanation and transparency. However, the quality of the information submitted by most 
VASPs is satisfactory.  As such, the overall quality of SARs within this sector is considered 
satisfactory.

Implementation of CDD and internal controls across the sector is satisfactory but require 
improvement. Findings from onsite inspections show a need for implementation of corrective 
measures concerning CDD/EDD though entities generally have controls in place.  
 
Both desk-based and onsite reviews show a high level of compliance with the ability to identify 
BO. Some issues surrounding full CDD and verification have been identified, which include 
the ability to understand the nature of business and circumstances of clients and identification 
of the BO where a complex or layered structure is presented. However, when responding to 
international cooperation requests the FSC has been able to provide BO information when 
requested and no counterpart has identified that such information is not accurate.  
 
The requirement under the AMLTFCOP to conduct institutional RAs came into force in the 
latter part of 2022. Licencees were, therefore, required to undergo their own self-assessment in 
2023. Consequently, the FSC’s review of entities’ institutional RAs commenced in 2024. As 
of November 2024, eight  entities have been inspected in relation to Institutional RA. Based on 
survey results, however, 15% of licencees in this sector are currently working on a TFRA. 56% 
have carried out a TFRA during the data period and 29% have considered TF risk but have not 
completed a full TFRA. 60% of licenced TCSPs also indicated that they have implemented 
relevant controls in line with the findings of their TFRA, while 20% have implemented some 
controls based on the findings of their TFRA. Another 20% have implemented some TF 
controls independent of a TFRA. 
 
In 79% of licencees, all employees have been trained on TF and the identification of TF within 
the last 3 years, while 21% have trained most of their employees on TF and the identification 
of TF within the last 3 years. 
  
70% of TCSPs have risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated within the data period, 
that specifically address TF risk. 23% have risk mitigation policies and procedures, updated 
during the data period that refer to and address TF risk to some extent and 7% have risk 
mitigation policies and procedures that cover TF to some extent but have not been updated 
during the data period.  
 
During the reporting period, TCSPs submitted a total of 1,313 SARs. This represents 10.61% 
of all SARs received by the FIA during that period. Only 2 of these were TF-related. The larger 
91 | P a g e  
 
TCSPs submitted the majority of the SARs. The quality of information submitted in the SARs 
filed by TCSPs is generally acceptable.  However, some SARs lack a reason for suspicion, a 
clear nexus to the VI, or details of the reported subject. At times, SARs received by these 
entities are more reactive rather than proactive. 
 
Overall, the quality of SAR reporting with the TCSP sector is considered satisfactory. However, 
given the size of the sector and the number of SARs filed, based on the number of clients held 
by each TCSP and other risk factors, the level of reporting is not commensurate with the 
inherent risk of this sector. 
 
Targeted Financial Sanctions Compliance –Inspection Results, Compliance with 
Requirements and Breaches:  
 
Twenty TFS themed inspections were conducted during 2020 – 2023, which focused on the 
entities' ability to identify TFS exposure, and the adequacy of their monitoring and reporting 
procedures. In relation to staff awareness, within 80% of entities all relevant staff were fully 
aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the Territory is exposed and understand how it 
impacts the work of their organisation. In 18% of TCSPs most relevant staff were fully aware, 
while in 2% of entities only some staff were aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts their organisation and sector.

carried out a TFRA during the data period and have implemented all relevant controls in line 
with the findings of their TFRA. Employees across the sector have been trained in TF and the 
identification of TF within the last 3 years. All entities have risk mitigation policies and 
procedures, updated within the data period, that specifically address TF risk. There were no 
instances where enforcement action needed to be taken against any licencee within the 
insolvency sector during the reporting period 
 
Relevant staff within the licencees are fully aware of TF risk and the TF risk to which the 
Territory is exposed and understand how it impacts the work of our organisation. 
 
During the reporting period 36 SARs were filed by IPs, which represents 0.29% of all SARs 
received. However, none of these SARs were TF-related. The quality of reporting is good and 
given the small size of the sector, this level of reporting is appropriate

5.1.9 Accountants 
7 of the 18 registered accountants conduct relevant business under the realm of IPs and have 
implemented CDD obligations/ internal controls across the sector or with AML/CFT 
compliance and awareness within the sector (according to FSC). 5 out of the 18 registered 
accountant engage in accounting activities such as auditing and not relevant financial business. 
Based on an initial desk-based review, while the remaining 6 registered accountants have 
AML/CFT policies in place that appeared to be in line with what is required in the AML/CFT 
legislation, these policies appeared to be generic and not risk based. Furthermore, some of the 
accountants do not have clear policies as it related to conducting CDD, specifically to identify 
the BOs, and they did not have any specific policies or procedures for holding adequate, 
93 | P a g e  
 
accurate and up to date information. As it relates to TF procedures, 66% of the accountants 
have specific targeted financial sanction procedures such as screening and reporting. While no 
TFS specific inspections have been conducted over the prior two years, the 2024 onsite 
inspection had an area of focus as it relates to financial sanctions obligations.  
 
Most accountants possess a general understanding of their TF risk as evident by their policies, 
procedures, systems and controls within their compliance programme as it relate to reporting 
and screening in keeping with their TFS obligations under the VI financial Sanction Guidelines 
2023.  
 
The recordkeeping measures are adequate as all accountants have indicated that they have 
record-keeping procedures and that they maintain records for 5 years and over in some cases. 
As it pertains to ongoing monitoring, most of the accountants did not provide sufficient policies 
and procedures to show that they conduct ongoing monitoring of their clients. Most accountants 
indicated that they do not place reliance on third parties and conduct and collect their own CDD.  
In relation to measures for PEPs, while many of the accountants do have policies, processes, 
and procedures in relation to PEPs and are aware of their obligation to identify and verify PEPs 
as well as apply the relevant ECDD measures, the process and procedures implemented  to 
screen and monitor  are not ongoing. As it relates to the quality of Reporting of Suspicious 
Transactions, between the period 2021-2023, 10 SARs were filed by 3 entities and it was 
indicated by the FIA-AIU that the quality of the SARs filed by the entities in this industry 
contained relevant information and provided valuable intelligence.   
 
Between September 2024 – October 2024, FIA-SEU conducted and concluded an onsite 
inspection on two accounting firms for the period 2021 – 2023. Each accountant received an 
overall rating of partially compliant due to deficiencies within their AML/CFT policies, 
procedures, systems and controls which coincides with the findings of the initial desk-based 
review highlighted above.  Some deficiencies included inadequate institutional and customer 
risk assessment, generic compliance programmes which were not risk-based, inadequate CDD 
and ECDD measures, lack of an independent audit and poor implementation of their financial 
sanctions obligations as while the entities did have sufficient policies and procedures in relation 
to financial sanctions, they could not adequately demonstrate that screenings were being 
conducted  systematically, at the start of the business relationship and on an ongoing basis.   
While the entities have a general understanding and knowledge of their AML/CFT obligations 
94 | P a g e  
 
there is some room for improvement. Therefore, in addition to remedial actions, the assessed 
entities were issued guidance documents in relation to institutional risk assessment, transaction 
monitoring, beneficial ownership and enhanced customer due diligence to provide further 
guidance to improve their AML/CFT/CPF measures and mitigate the risk of ML/TF and PF 
within their sector.  
 
Although the trainings conducted covered the broad AML/CFT/CPF obligations, there were 
deficiencies: The trainings were not risk-based, targeted, or tailored to the appropriate 
employee responsibility in keeping with the requirements of AMLTF Code. Some of the 
training was not designed to test employee’s knowledge of money laundering, terrorist 
financing and proliferation financing issues commensurate with established standards pursuant 
to section 48 of the AMLTF Code. And therefore, the entities were not able to adequately 
demonstrate that that employee had a good understanding of their AML/CFT/CPF obligations.

5.1.10 Lawyers and Notaries 
Based on an initial desk-based review, over 80% of the registered legal practitioners have 
undertaken an institutional RA but most have not considered specific TF risk, except most of 
the larger global firms who are more susceptible to these risk based on their clientele. The legal 
practitioner sector does have general policies and procedures in place which appear to be in 
line with the VI’s AML/CFT legislations. Many have additional policy documents that further 
outline TF and CDD related policies, processes and procedures.  Over 90% of the legal 
practitioners have specific targeted financial sanction procedures such as screening and 
reporting.  Most legal practitioners possess a general understanding of their TF risk as evident 
95 | P a g e  
 
by their policies, procedures, systems and controls they have in place such as reporting and 
screening in keeping with their TF obligations under the VI financial Sanction Guidelines 2023.  
 
As it relates to the quality of reporting of suspicious transactions, between the period 2021-
2023, 35 SARs were filed by 8 entities and it was indicated by the FIA-AIU that the quality of 
the SARs filed by the entities in this industry contained relevant information and provided 
valuable intelligence. 
 
Between September 2024 – October 2024, FIA-SEU conducted and concluded an onsite 
inspection on ten legal practitioner firms for the period 2021 – 2023. Seven entities received 
an overall rating of Largely compliant due to adequate AML/CFT/CPF Policies, Procedures, 
systems and controls in place to mitigate ML/TF and PF risks such as, inter alia,  adequate and 
updated institutional/ customer risk assessment, adequate CDD and ECDD measures,  
systematic and risk-based training, effective ongoing monitoring procedures, adequate TFS 
screening and monitoring measures and systems, proper record keeping procedures and 
effective reporting policies . Three entities indicated that they use introducers and comply with 
the relevant legislation by executing written agreements and testing of the relationship, where 
applicable. However, three of the entities attained an overall rating of partially compliant due 
to deficiencies within their AML/CFT policies, procedures, systems and controls which 
coincides with the findings of the initial desk-based review highlighted above.  Some 
deficiencies include inadequate institutional and customer risk assessment, generic compliance 
programme which is not risk-based, inadequate CDD and ECDD measures, lack of an 
independent audit, poor implementation of their financial sanction’s obligations. Therefore, in 
addition to remedial actions, the assessed entities were issued guidance documents in relation 
to  institutional risk assessment, transaction monitoring, beneficial ownership and enhanced 
customer due diligence to provide further guidance to improve their AML/CFT/CPF measures 
and mitigate the risk of ML/TF and PF within their sector.  However, most of the assessed 
entities are aware of their AML/CFT/CPF obligations given their affiliation with global entities 
with international standards. Sufficient training is provided to staff of most of the entities 
(especially the global firms) which is targeted and tailored and included testing.

5.1.11 Real Estate Agents 
Based on initial desk-based review 53% of the REAs have undertaken an institutional RA but 
have not carried out an entity-level TFRA. Therefore, although the REAs have AML/CFT/CPF 
policies and procedures in place which appear to be in line with the VI’s AML/CFT 
Legislations, some appear to be generic and are not commensurate with their risk. They do not 
have clear policies as it relates to conducting CDD specifically to identify the BOs, and they 
do not include any specific policies or procedures for holding adequate, accurate and up to date 
information. Only a few of the REAs have specific targeted financial sanction procedures such 
as screening and reporting procedures.  While no TFS specific inspections have been conducted 
over the last two years the 2024 onsite inspection had an area of focus as it relates to financial 
sanctions obligations. Most REAs possess a general understanding of their TF risk as evident 
by their policies, procedures, systems and controls they have in place such as reporting and 
screening in keeping with their TF obligations under the VI financial Sanction Guidelines 2023. 
Recordkeeping measures were found to be adequate as most REAs have indicated that they 
have record-keeping procedures and that they maintain records for 5 years. Between 2021 and 
2023 only 1 SAR was filed by 1 entity. 
 
Between September 2024 – October 2024, FIA-SEU conducted and concluded an onsite 
inspection on four real estates for the period 2021 – 2023. Each real estate agent received an 
overall rating of partially compliant due to deficiencies within their AML/CFT policies, 
procedures, systems and controls which coincides with the findings of the initial desk-based 
review highlighted above.  Some deficiencies include inadequate institutional and customer 
risk assessment, generic compliance programme which is not risk-based, unsystematic and

While the Real Estate sector conducted training within their respective organisations, the 
trainings were not risk-based, targeted, or tailored to the appropriate employee responsibility 
in keeping with the requirements of AMLTF Code. Additionally, although the training covered 
the broad AML/CFT/CPF obligations, the content was not substantial to demonstrate that the 
employees have an in-depth understanding of each AML/CFT/CPF obligation. For many of 
the entities a testing mechanism as outlined in section 48 of the AMLTF Code was not 
implemented to demonstrate that employees had a good understanding of their AML/CFT/CPF 
obligations. Additionally, in one instance,  a real estate agent did not implement a systematic 
training programme which is not in keeping with Section 48 of the AMLTF Code which states 
that an entity should ensure that training be conducted for each employee at least once a year.

Based on an initial desk-based review 62% of the registered HVGDs appear to have not 
undertaken an institutional RA and therefore, their policies and procedures are not risk-based. 
Therefore, although the HVGD have AML/CFT/CPF policies and procedures in place which 
appear to be in line with the VI’s AML/CFT Legislations, they are generic and do not

Most HVGDs possess a general understanding of their TF risk as evident by their policies,

obligations, which are in keeping with the VI Sanctions Guidelines. Between 2021 and 2023 
no SARs were filed by the HVGD sector. 
 
Between September 2024 – October 2024, FIA-SEU conducted and concluded an onsite 
inspection on four HVGD for the period 2021 – 2023. Each DPMS received an overall rating 
of partially compliant due to deficiencies within their AML/CFT policies, procedures, systems 
and controls which coincides with the findings of the initial desk-based review highlighted 
above.  Some deficiencies include inadequate institutional and customer risk assessment, 
generic compliance programme which is not risk-based, unsystematic and  general training not

Legal Persons and Arrangements Controls 
As a detailed and targeted RA of LPLAs and their ML, TF and PF risk in the VI took place in 
2024, this enabled current and accurate data to be utilised and considered in relation to TF risk. 
The LPLA RA concluded that overall controls were satisfactory. 
 
In relation to general controls, in the VI, nominee shareholders must disclose their status to the 
registered agent of the legal person for which they act as nominee. ROCA does not currently 
verify the accuracy of BO information provided and does not impose penalties for failure to 
provide or update BO information. Recent legislative changes have now made this a 
requirement, and processes are currently being put into place to allow for the maintenance of 
this information.  The FSC, however, does require TCSPs to maintain BO information on their 
clients in keeping with AML/CFT legislation and this requirement is tested through the FSC’s

compliance inspection process and penalties are imposed for failure to maintain adequate, 
accurate and up to date BO information. The concept of nominee director does not exist in the 
VI. Bearer shares are prohibited. Therefore, this was assessed as satisfactory because the BO 
registry and related legislative changes are not yet in force. 
 
As it relates to access to information, the following factors were assessed: LEAs and competent 
authorities can access basic and BO information on a timely basis, while foreign authorities 
can access basic and BO information through the normal information exchange channels.  
Authorities can exchange information on shareholders and there is an avenue for foreign 
counterparts to access BO information, as agencies responsible for responding to international 
requests are publicly known, FIs and DNFBPs in the country can access basic information on 
a timely basis. The assessment revealed that LEAs, competent authorities, FIs and DNFBPs 
can always access the information listed above on a timely basis. The rating on this factor was 
Good.  
 
The LPLA RA also considered the compliance levels of entities in gatekeeper roles, including 
TCSPs and legal professionals, with AML/CFT requirements, as gatekeepers that are 
compliant with AML/CFT obligations can detect bad actors and prevent them from operating 
a legal person or legal arrangement in the VI.  
 
For FIs and TCSPs, compliance with controls was rated as generally good or satisfactory, 
except for ongoing monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities, which were rated as weak. 
Overall, the level of compliance for this group is satisfactory. The compliance level of the legal 
and accounting professions was weaker than for TCSPs and FIs. The compliance of the legal 
profession was rated as weak or very weak on the issues of business RAs, CDD measures, 
reliance on third parties, internal controls and SAR filings. The accounting profession was 
assessed as having the same weaknesses as the legal profession with the addition of weakness 
in ongoing monitoring. Overall, the level of compliance for this group was found to be weak.108  
As this area was considered separately in the LPLA Risk Assessment, the table of residual risk 
scores was also considered there and is located below. (As can be seen from the table the 
 
108 Given that TCSPs and FIs are more likely to be involved in company formation and ongoing monitoring than 
lawyers and accountants, the satisfactory rating for FIs and TCSPs was given more weight than the rating for 
lawyers and accountants, for an overall rating of satisfactory on this factor.

residual risk for legal arrangements is ML, the controls were found to be satisfactory, and the 
main weakness was in the controls is the compliance of the FIs and DNFBPs with their 
regulatory obligations.

NPO Controls 
 
As indicated above, a sectorial RA of NPOs and their TF risk was concluded in August 2024, 
and this enabled the current assessment of TF of the NPO sector in the VI to be considered. 
The NPO RA concluded that controls were adequate given the low level of TF threat and abuse 
but not risk-based.  
While the NPOs’ policies and procedures are in keeping with some aspects of FATF 
Recommendation 8, they are applied to all NPOs in the VI. Therefore, a risk-based approach 
must be adopted to ensure the measures are commensurate with the risks identified. 
 
109 Table 13, of the LPLA RA 2025 
103 | P a g e  
 
Additionally, these measures should be CFT focused and in line with Recommendation 8 in 
order to effectively mitigate TF risks within the NPO Sector. 
Further, it is apparent that further CFT training and awareness is required among the NPO 
sector, especially for the higher risk NPOs, in order to promote accountability, integrity and 
public confidence in the administration and management of NPOs through improvement and 
development of the relevant policies and procedures. Furthermore, a collaborative effort is 
necessary to ensure that NPOs develop and refine best practices to address TF risk and 
vulnerabilities and thus protect them from TF abuse. 
While there exist inherent vulnerabilities within the NPO sector and deficiencies in the 
legislative framework, the overall inherent risk is assessed as low due to the low level of TF 
threat and abuse. However, both public and private stakeholders play a pivotal role in ensuring 
that these vulnerabilities are not exploited for TF and other illicit purposes 
In accordance with the AML Code, NPOs in the VI are required to implement policies, 
procedures, systems and internal controls which promote accountability and integrity and 
mitigate the risk of money laundering, TF and proliferation financing. Based on the data 
collected, 56% of faith based NPOs claimed that they have the relevant policies and procedures 
in place via their constitution, bylaws or articles of incorporation, standard code of conduct and 
internal code of polices for transparency and accountability with 19% possessing an AML/CFT 
compliance manual. Most of the NPOs in the VI do not possess an AML/CFT compliance 
manual and therefore do not have adequate CFT Policies governing their organisation. 
 
In relation to the adequacy of internal policies and procedures, Charitable NPOs are the main 
NPOs that cross-check the name of their staff, donor or volunteers against the UN sanction list, 
UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation website, and the US OFAC list. Only 6.25% 
of the Religious NPOs cross reference the name of their staff, donors or volunteers with 
designated individual and entities on the UN Sanctions List as the NPOs claimed that most of 
their donors and staff are members or known individuals with a connection to the religious 
organisation. However, 56.25% of the Religious NPOs engage in basic vetting procedures for 
donors which include name, address and source of funds and may request the completion of a 
membership form or the donor’s licencing certificate for verification purposes.  Whilst most of 
the NPOs claimed that they are not aware of whether their donors are PEPs or have CFT 
104 | P a g e  
 
policies, the international donors that provide funding to these organisations are not located in 
high-risk jurisdictions, or in proximity to countries with an active terrorist threat.  
 
Over 95% of the NPOs indicated that all transactions are recorded either manually, 
electronically or both for an average period of 5 to 7 years.  Additionally, 56% of the Religious 
NPOs claimed that they review the transactions for suspicious patterns of activity per activity 
or monthly during their bank reconciliation period. Moreover, over 90 % of the FATF NPOs 
indicated that they have completed and submitted annual financial statements to the NPO Board 
which facilitate a level of transparency and accountability.  
5.4  
Controls Relating to the Use and Movement of Cash and Dealers in Precious 
Metals and  Stones  
In relation to controls specific to the use of cash, the ability of HMC to detect incoming and 
outgoing movement of cash and to take action was considered. Additionally controls on the 
use of cash within the regulated sectors were also considered. The legislative framework is in 
place to detect illicit cash and PM&S, and the controls were found to be satisfactory. 
5.5  
Controls - Public Sector  
The controls in effect in the public sector as it relates to supervision were rated as satisfactory. 
To reach this conclusion, an assessment was made in relation to public sector (and regulator) 
activity, monitoring and enforcement including the percentage of the sector subject to an offsite 
inspection over the last 2 years including the percentage of higher risk entities within the sector 
that were subject to an offsite and / or onsite examination. The level of enforcement action 
taken in relation to each sector as it relates to TF was also considered. The adequacy of the 
resources of supervisors to adequately monitor the implementation of counter TF measures 
within each sector was also taken into account as well as the expertise and training of the public 
sector. The level of industry engagement relating to TF was also assessed.  
5.5.1 The Financial Services Commission 
The FSC’s Regulatory division consists of the Authorisation and Supervision Division (ASD), 
the Enforcement Division, the Compliance Inspection Unit and the AML Unit. The ASD 
consists of four Units: Authorisation, Specialised Supervision, Prudential Supervision and 
105 | P a g e  
 
Market Conduct110. The Authorisation Unit (AU) consists of one Deputy Director, three Senior 
Regulators and thirteen Regulators I/II.   The AU is the centralised unit responsible for 
authorisation and cessation activities of all regulated persons and receives and processes all 
pre-licencing and post-licencing applications for consideration and potential approval.  The 
AU's function is to ensure that all applicants and existing regulated entities satisfy the 
requirements to carry out regulated activities.  On average, the AU processes approximately 
one hundred and thirty-four  applications monthly.  
 
The Prudential Supervision Unit (PSU) consists of one Deputy Director, two Senior Regulators 
and ten Regulators I/II.   The PSU is responsible for monitoring and supervising regulated 
entities that present a lower level of risk to the financial services sector.111  There are currently 
600 licenced entities under PSU’s portfolio.   
 
The SSU consists of one Deputy Director, two Senior Regulators and seven Regulators I/II. Its 
function is to monitor and supervise systemically important financial institutions and other 
regulated entities with a higher level of risk.  The SSU is responsible for undertaking proactive 
and enhanced supervision of these entities.  There are currently 124 licenced entities across the 
banking (7), MSB (2), Financing (3), TCSP (93), IB (11), Insurance (6) and VASP (9) sectors 
under SSU’s portfolio.112 
 
The Enforcement Division consists of one Deputy Director (vacant), two Senior Enforcement 
Officers and four Enforcement Officers I/II.  Its function is to lead on taking enforcement action 
against licencees and unauthorised persons who commit breaches of relevant laws. The ED is 
responsible for conducting investigations, monitoring and presenting all matters relating to 
contraventions to the FSC’s Enforcement Committee for consideration of enforcement action.  
The ED receives and analyses intelligence on behalf of the FSC and conducts investigations of 
serious breaches of financial services legislation. Its investigative work ranges from regulatory 
breaches, such as entities engaging in unauthorised financial services activity, to cases where 
non-regulated BVI Business Companies are being used for unlawful purposes. 
 
110 The Market Conduct Unit consists of one prudential conduct manager and one Regulator.  MCU’s function is 
to promote a fair and transparent market in which all stakeholders within the financial services industry are treated 
fairly, honestly, and professionally.   
111 It is also responsible for reviewing and processing all post-licencing filings required to be submitted by existing 
regulated entities and regulated persons.   
112 As of November 2024. 
106 | P a g e  
 
 
The Compliance Inspection Unit (CIU) consists of one Deputy Director, four Senior Regulators, 
four Regulators Is, four Regulator IIs and 1 Administrative Assistant. The CIU’s mandate is to 
undertake onsite reviews of licencees across all sectors through the planning, preparing and 
conducting of onsite inspections. The primary focus of the CIU is AML/CFT and prudential 
inspections.  The CIU undertakes full scope and/or thematic examinations of specific entities 
or sectors based on identifiable risks and assesses licencees levels of compliance with 
requirements of relevant financial services legislation.   
 
The AML/CFT Unit consists of one Deputy Director, two senior level analysts and one junior 
analyst and is responsible for developing and implementing the FSC’s AML/CFT supervisory 
and regulatory strategy and policy and keeping abreast of AML/CFT international standards 
and advising the FSC on how to incorporate changes into the regulatory framework to ensure 
the jurisdiction’s compliance with such standards.  The AMLU is also responsible for the 
monitoring of international sanctions and other restrictive measures, while providing key 
stakeholders with relevant information and guidance to promote integrity and stability within 
the financial services industry in the VI.  
 
Training 
 
All FSC regulatory staff are subjected to mandatory AML/CFT introductory training and 
annual AML/CFT training. A majority of regulatory staff have achieved relevant AML/CFT 
qualifications such as those issued by ICA and CAMs. Staff from, ASD, AMLU, Compliance 
Inspections Unit and the Enforcement Division have participated directly in CFT training 
related to investigating TF, how to identify TF, and use of VAs in TF. This training included 
sessions facilitated by OFSI, FCDO, ACAMS and RSS Asset Recovery. In addition, the FSC 
is a member of the OT’s TF Forum which meets bi-annually and provides participants with the 
opportunity to discuss emerging TF risks and trends and share best practices. It also participates 
in the annual FCDO Sanctions Forum.  In March 2024 the FSC participated in a multi-agency 
sanctions tabletop exercise sponsored by the FCDO, which included elements of TF.  In June 
2024 staff also attended a multi-agency workshop on TF and TFS.  Staff have also received 
FATF assessor and standards training which has aided in enhancing the understanding of their 
CFT obligations as a regulator of financial services.

Publications/Guidance 
 
In 2021, the FSC published the findings of the 2020 ML and TFRA for the MSB Sector. In 
2022, the FSC produced a 20-minute video, which provided viewers with information on TFS 
and discussed their obligations in relation to, amongst other things, screening and reporting. 
This video has garnered 343 views. In addition, the Virgin Islands Sanctions Guidelines, which 
cover TFS for TF were updated and re-issued in 2023.  In 2024, as part of a collaborative 
outreach effort between various public sector agencies and private sector associations, the 
Sanctions Coordinator within the AGC delivered a presentation to 262 industry professionals 
on their sanctions obligations with regard to implementing and enforcing TFS including those 
relative to TF. 
 
Banks, Money Services Business, Insurance, Insolvency and Financing 
 
Over the last two years, all banks have been subjected to ongoing desk-based reviews which 
include reviews of AML/CFT returns, prudential returns and compliance officer reports which 
address AML/CFT issues. This means all higher risk banks have been reviewed offsite during 
this period. In relation to onsite inspections, two of the seven banks (29%) have been inspected 
within the past two years. Furthermore, 100% of the banking inspections were conducted at the 
banks that presented the highest risks within the sector. All inspections for Banks are full scope 
and encompass a TFS review and assessment. It is expected that all seven banks will be 
inspected by the end of 2025. During the reporting period there were no instances where 
enforcement action needed to be taken against any licencee within the banking sector. 
AML/CFT Guidelines for the Banking sector were issued in July 2020.  In 2021, the FSC 
published the findings of the 2020 ML and TFRA for the Banking Sector.   
 
Although one MSB is risk-rated as L and the other ML for ML/TF risk, due to the cash intensive 
nature of MSB, for supervisory purposes, both are classified as systematically important and 
subject to specialised supervision by the FSC.  As such all MSBs were subject to desk-based 
and ongoing supervision between 2022 and 2023. In addition to desk-based monitoring, 50% 
of MSBs were subject to onsite inspection between 2022 and 2023. No instances requiring 
enforcement action needed to be taken within the MSB sector during the reporting period. 
AML/CFT Guidelines for the MSB sector were issued in 2016. In 2021, the FSC published the 
findings of the 2020 ML and TFRA for the MSB Sector.   
108 | P a g e  
 
 
Fifty-two insurance licencees (insurers and intermediaries) (29%) have been subject to desk-
based reviews between 2022 and 2023. All higher risk entities were subjected to review. No 
inspection of insurers or insurance intermediaries between 2022 and 2023 included TFS given 
the identified low risk. No AML/CFT breaches including TFS related breaches requiring 
enforcement action needed to be taken within the insurance sector during the reporting period. 
In 2021, the FSC published the findings of the 2020 ML and TFRA for the Insurance Sector.   
 
Given the low-risk nature of insolvency work, no IPs were subject to inspection (onsite or 
offsite) over the last 2 years. Further, there were no instances where enforcement action needed 
to be taken against any licencee within the insolvency sector during the reporting period.  
 
All FBs underwent desk-based reviews during the reporting period. However, there have been 
no onsite inspections of FB licencees over the last three years due to the low level of risk posed. 
During the reporting period there were no instances where enforcement action needed to be 
taken against any licencee within the financing sector. In 2021, the FSC published the findings 
of the 2020 ML and TFRA for the Financing Sector.

As it relates to IB, all higher risk entities are subjected to review through desk-based 
assessments as part of the FSC’s risk-assessment framework. At the end of 2023, five IBs 
109 | P a g e  
 
(2.17% of the IB sector), accounting for 22 categories of licence collectively were considered 
‘higher risk’ having received a risk rating of MH (20) or H (2) and are under the supervision 
of the FSC’s SSU. These entities have relationship managers who assess the level of risk 
annually and on an ongoing basis. Between 2022 and 2023 sixty-seven IB licencees were 
subject to desk-based review.  Thirteen IB licencees have been subject to on-site inspections 
between 2020 and 2023.  Five of the thirteen IB licencees reviewed onsite were higher risk 
licencees, supervised by the specialised supervision unit. However, no inspection of IB 
licencees between 2022 and 2023 included TFS. The total number of IB inspections carried out 
represents 9.98% of the IB Sector and 45% of the IB licencees under the remit of the 
Specialised Supervision Unit. There are 16 IB inspections scheduled for 2024 that will include 
a review of licencees’ systems, policies and procedures for handling TFS and effectiveness of 
such systems.

VASPs came under the FSC’s supervisory remit in 2023, with the first licence being issued in 
2024.  As such, no inspections have been carried out yet, nor have there been any instances 
where enforcement action has needed to be taken against any VASP licencee. The FSC has 
adopted a comprehensive approach to licencing and supervision, including providing clear and 
detailed guidance to entities during the onboarding process, conducting detailed assessments 
of each entity's current practices, identifying areas requiring modification, and providing 
tailored guidance to facilitate the transition.  
 
110 | P a g e  
 
In 2023, the FSC issued specific AML/CFT Guidelines for VASPs.  In addition, as part of its 
continual outreach efforts, during its October 2023 Meet the Regulator Forum the FSC 
presented to the industry on VASP Processes and Procedures.  This event was attended by 
approximately 300 persons.  The FSC also published its Virtual Assets Service Providers’ 
AML Guidelines: A Tool for Demonstrating Compliance in 2024.  In addition, an article was 
published in the March 2024 issue of the FSC’s newsletter focused on the findings of the 2022 
MLRA relative to the higher-risk TCSP, VASP and IB sectors.  Additionally, the FSC issued 
guidance on the VASP Travel rule during the review period.

Higher risk TCSPs are subjected to review through desk-based assessments as part of the FSC’s 
risk-assessment framework. These entities have relationship managers who annually, and on 
an ongoing basis, assess the level of risk.  At the end of 2023, seven TCSPs (2.4%) were 
considered ‘higher risk’ having received a risk rating of MH (5) or H (3) and are under the 
supervision of the FSC’s SSU. Thirty-seven TCSPs (13%) have been subject to onsite 
inspections between 2020and 2023. Of the thirty-seven TCSPs inspected, 18 (49%) were 
higher-risk entities that fall under the FSC’s specialised supervision regime. 
 
 
113 The activity was not subject to licencing until 2024, therefore entities were not subject to onsite inspection 
during the reporting period. 
111 | P a g e  
 
Between 2020 and 2023, nine TCSPs, rated as Higher Risk, were subject to an on-site 
inspection. This accounted for 41% of all licencees rated as higher risk. Three of the nine 
inspections conducted were full scope inspections, which aimed to understand the 
implementation and effectiveness of the licencees’ ML/TF compliance framework. The 
remaining six inspections were thematic and focused on areas that posed higher ML/TF risk, 
such as Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) and Sanctions Handling. It should also be noted that 
the onsite inspection strategy isolates and considers the ML/TF risk score. As such, all thematic 
inspections conducted during the period of 2020 – 2023 generally focused on those TCSPs 
with elevated ML/TF risk scores. 
 
During the reporting period various enforcement actions were taken within the TCSP sector.  
Actions included the issuance of warning letters, directives and public statements, as well as 
the revocation of 5 licences and the imposition of $1,063,500 in administrative penalties, 
$450,000 of which related to AML breaches.  None, however, were as a result of any TF or 
TFS breaches. In 2023, the FSC issued AML/CFT specific guidance for TCSPs. An article was 
also published in the March 2024 issue of the FSC’s newsletter focused on the findings of the 
2022 MLRA relative to the higher-risk TCSP, VASP and IB sectors.

5.5.2  Financial Investigation Agency Supervision 
The FIA-SEU supervises legal practitioners and accountants undertaking relevant business in 
accordance with the AMLRs, REAs, HVGDs, DPMS, and NPOs.  The FIA-SEU consists of 
one Deputy Director, one Chief Compliance Examiner, one Senior Compliance Examiner, two 
examiners, and three junior compliance examiners currently undergoing training. Each 
individual is equipped with two PCs which facilitate efficiency as well as access to websites 
such as FATF e-learning and ECOFEL to facilitate developing knowledge in AML/CFT/CPF. 
While some staff have attained training in CFT and TFS at different levels, further training is 
required as this area is new to most. The FIA-SEU has completed onsite examination of 25 
entities which provided a greater understanding of the adequacy of the AML/CFT/CPF 
policies, procedures, controls and systems their supervised entities have in place to combat 
ML/TF/PF risks inclusive of their level of TFS compliance No enforcement action has been 
taken in relation to TF matters for the period 2021-2023.   
 
Over the past 3 years, the VI has provided the following TF-specific guidance: The Virgin 
Islands Sanctions Guidelines 2023, Guidance Notes on Terrorist Financing Risk and Red flags 
for NPOs 2023 and sector specific guidance on ‘What is terrorist financing?’ for legal 
practitioners and Accountants, REAs / jewellers / DPMS, Boat and Yacht Brokers and Vehicle 
Dealers. For the last 2 years, the FIA-SEU has not conducted any inspections within the 
accounting sector.  
The FIA-SEU did not conduct full inspections for the Legal Practitioner sector in 2022 or 2023. 
A total of seven legal practitioners were subject to CDD thematic examination in 2021 and 
received a non-compliant rating for major deficiencies in their CDD processes and procedures.   
Between 2022 and 2023, the FIA-SEU did not conduct any full scope inspections within the 
real estate sector. A total of four real estate agents were subject to CDD Thematic examination 
in 2021 with two entities receiving a largely compliant rating for their CDD policies and 
procedures.   
In 2022 and 2023, the FIA has not conducted full inspections with the DPMS sector. A total of 
two DPMS were subject to CDD Thematic examination in 2021 with two entities receiving a 
rating of partially and non-compliant respectively as it relates to their CDD policies and 
procedures.    
113 | P a g e  
 
In 2022 and 2023 years, the FIA has not conducted full inspections with the HVGD sector. A 
total of six HVGD were subject to CDD Thematic examination in 2021 with most of the entities 
receiving a rating of non-compliant in relation to their CDD policies and procedures.  
However, in 2024 the FIA-SEU carried out a number of onsite inspections as detailed above.

The conclusion of controls as it relates to the FIA Supervision was satisfactory. 
5.5.4  Controls – Law Enforcement, Financial Investigation Agency - Analysis and 
Investigation Unit, Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General’s Chambers: 
The extent to which law enforcement provided an effective control was also considered. Each 
Law Enforcement or related agency was considered, namely RVIPF-intelligence, RVIPF FCU 
and the remaining RVIPF units. HMC and DOI were also assessed as well as the FIA-AIU 
and the ODPP. The level of enforcement action taken114 was considered, as well as the 
available resources of the LEAs115. The expertise and training116 of the LEAs as it relates to 
TF was also considered. For each LEA a rating was allocated. These were then combined to 
 
114 *Enforcement action is taken as required in relation to TF matters: Good 
*Enforcement action is taken in most cases where it is required in TF matters: Satisfactory 
*There is insufficient enforcement for TF breaches: Weak 
*There is no enforcement where TF breaches or offences occur: Very weak 
115 *Resources are sufficient: Good 
*Some improvement needed: Satisfactory 
*Difficult to complete TF mandate with current staff levels; *Weak - Cannot complete TF mandate with current 
staff levels: Very Weak 
116 *Sufficient staff have expertise in TF and / or training in TF.

*Some experience and training but insufficient to complete TF mandate: Weak 
*No staff with TF expertise or training: Very Weak

deduce the overall rating for the extent to which law enforcement operated as an effective 
control in reducing TF risk. 
 
The FIA-AIU attended four training sessions in 2022 and 2023 geared towards CFT and has 
obtained two new analysts experienced in VAs as well as virtual asset software which assists 
in its analysis of VA related matters. The FIA-AIU considers that it has adequate resources to 
deal with the Territory’s TF risk. 
 
The RVIPF-FCU had insufficient resources during the period 2020 to 2023. However, the 
agreed new staffing levels for the FCU Team are nine Detective Constables, a Financial 
Analyst, two Detective Sergeants and a Detective Inspector. At the time of the RA the posts 
had received funding, but had not all been filled. As the RVIPF-FCU is fundamental to the 
investigation and onwards prosecution of TF matters this matter was given additional weight 
above CFT knowledge, although the FCU officers who are in place have had TF training, it is 
anticipated that due to the changes agreed in 2024, once positions are filled, this deficiency 
will be remediated. The officers of the FCU have received the following training: Sanctions 
Breach training hosted by the UK Financial Intelligence Unit and the UK Sanctions 
Directorate, TF tabletop exercise, Investigation of Terrorist Financing practical exercise for 
one week and attendance at the Overseas Territories TF Forum. Additional Training has been 
confirmed, namely the National Crime Agency training on: Financial Intelligence, Financial 
Investigation, Restraint, Confiscation, Senior Appropriate Officer and Cryptocurrency. 
Enhanced case management has been implemented to measure performance of investigations 
into TF.  Technical resources have been budgeted for. These tools are vital for a Financial 
Crime Unit to function effectively. These include a system and software for financial analysis 
for the Financial Analyst. A crypto analytical software to assist with virtual asset investigation 
including blockchain analysis at the time of the risk assessment was in the procurement phase. 
 
The FCU has issued new policies in relation to international cooperation and intelligence 
sharing (September 2024) and The Investigation of Legal Persons and Legal Arrangements 
(finalised and circulated in September 2024). Additionally, the FCU has initiated a new 
procedure utilising Collaborative Law Enforcement Agencies (CLEA), whereby TF risks and 
trends are monitored and brought to the attention of CLEA members. A TF Trends and 
Typologies policy was also finalised and circulated in September 2024. At the time of the RA 
115 | P a g e  
 
the FCU was leading the TF investigation and prosecution strategy, to be completed in Q1 
2025. 
 
A Memorandum of Understanding between the RVIPF FCU and the FIA-AIU has been 
updated to reflect and prioritise TF investigations and suspected sanctions breaches. Feedback 
is to be provided on the quality of intelligence provided. The monitoring of investigations and 
timescales for the provision of intelligence has been adopted. Operational and Strategic 
meetings take place at monthly and quarterly intervals respectively.  
 
RVIPF Intelligence is undergoing a review of the IU in relation to the Law Enforcement 
Review. The new structure will allow for better sharing of information with the analysts that 
will be based within the RVIPF FCU and there will be some ongoing intelligence gathering in 
relation to VAs and informal transfer services. The Intelligence Officers will be trained in 
processing and developing TF intelligence received. RVIPF Intelligence was unable to provide 
relevant data or analysis and stated that there was insufficient training on terrorism or TF. 
Requests in relation to financial matters were sent to FIA-AIU where they were dealt with, but 
RVIPF Intelligence was not able to provide further information on these requests or responses 
to them or indeed in relation to requests which did not go to FIA-AIU. It was noted that there 
was little capability or capacity within the unit to undertake any financial intelligence 
development or analysis.  It was also noted that no financial or TF training had been 
undertaken.117 
 
Whilst there have not been any terrorism or TF cases during the review period, the ODPP 
underwent specialised training in October 2024 and January 2025 which included the 
prosecution of TF cases. An expansion of the ODPP is also underway which will increase 
capacity in all financial crime matters including TF through the creation of a Financial Unit 
within the ODPP, for which Crown Counsel and Senior Crown Counsel had been put in place 
and additional recruitment was budgeted for and underway. 
 
The AGC-IC has adequate resources to deal with requests relating to Terrorism and TF, namely 
one dedicated Crown Counsel, with two additional Crown Counsel, one dedicated Case 
Manager and one Legal intern. The International Relations Counsel has received TF training 
 
117 One officer had completed online seminars in relation to Crypto Currencies.

from CFATF and Senior Crown Counsel leading the ICT in the AGC gained knowledge while 
pursuing an LLB in Financial Crimes Regulations and cryptocurrency certification. 
 
The DOI’s organisational structure in 2024 entails a total of 77 persons employed across the 
various units of the department. There are currently 54 Immigration Officers within the Border 
Management Unit, who are assigned to ports of entry across the VI, whose main function is to 
perform inspections of persons entering and departing the Territory. There are 13 members of 
staff within the DOI’s Administration Unit and 10 officers within the Enforcement Unit.  
Therefore, the DOI remains drastically understaffed in all units. It is anticipated that in 2025 a 
further four Enforcement Officer posts will be funded to further augment work in areas related 
to enforcement, compliance, investigations and monitoring in TF and TFS matters. Currently, 
only members of the Enforcement Unit, the senior management team and a few immigration 
officers have been trained in TF and TFS and have general knowledge of the subject area. In 
June 2024, five officers from DOI’s Management and Enforcement Unit attended TF and TFS 
Training.  In 2020, the DOI upgraded its border management system from the non-operational 
Entrex system to the advanced Border Management and E-Visa System. Enforcement officers 
utilise the system to analyse travel patterns, particularly focusing on movement to and from 
high-risk jurisdictions. The system has proven effective not only in identifying potential 
entrants from high-risk areas but also in tracking those who have successfully entered the 
territory for purposes such as employment or residency over the reporting period.  
 
65 Officers are currently active in HMC. 130 Officers are needed to adequately carry out the 
tasks of the HMC. No improvement has been made since 2017 to improve staffing efficiency. 
Before hurricane Irma, the department had approximately 110 Officers. Only a handful of 
officers are knowledgeable of TF and TFS. Hiring of staffing is in progress. TF training was 
undertaken in 2021, and the Financial Crime Investigation Training Course was attended in 
July 2024. A Risk Management Unit is to be created that will focus, amongst other things, on 
TF related matters. HMC has engaged The Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre 
(CARTAC) is in the process of implementing a RA group, which will give the department the 
ability to assess/track movements of persons/goods with links to TF high risk countries and 
utilising the VI as a transit points.118 With collaboration with the other jurisdictions this will 
give HMC the ability to intercept the movement of cash by utilising intelligence-led operations. 
 
118 HMC also noted that the incorporation of risk management in legislation was being considered.

Each of the individual ratings was considered as well as their weighting, particularly in relation 
to resources at the RVIPF-FCU which is fundamental to the investigation and ultimate 
prosecution of TF matters in line with the risk profile of the jurisdiction. Whilst additional 
resources have been allocated, they were not yet in place at the time of this risk assessment and 
therefore the overall conclusion was that the rating of weak was appropriate for the law 
enforcement controls.

Residual Risk 
In order to reach a determination in relation to the risk of the collection, movement and use of 
terrorist funds in the VI as well as the risk of each typology being utilised for the purposes of 
TF, the controls, namely private sector controls, public sector controls and law enforcement 
controls were applied to the likelihood rating in order to determine the overall residual risk 
rating.

Consequences 
In the TF context, consequence refers to the impact or harm that a TF threat may cause if 
eventuated. This includes the effect of the underlying terrorist activity on domestic or 
institutional financial systems and institutions, as well as the economy and society more 
generally. Notably, consequences of TF are likely to be more severe than for ML or other types 
of financial crime (e.g. tax fraud etc.), which impacts how countries respond to identified 
threats. Consequences of TF are also likely to differ between countries and between TF 
channels or sources, and may relate to specific communities or populations, the business 
environment, or national interests. Given the challenges in assessing consequences, countries 
need not take a scientific approach when considering consequences and instead may want to 
start with the presumption that consequences of TF will be severe (whether domestic or 
elsewhere) and consider whether there are any factors that would alter that conclusion.120 
 
The WG agreed at its first meeting that this would be the approach whereby there will be a 
presumption that the consequences are severe, and consideration would be given as to whether 
this conclusion is altered based on the findings of the assessment.  
8. 
Conclusion 
The WG concluded that the risk of the collection of funds for TF in the VI was Low. The risk 
of the use of funds for TF purposes in the VI was also Low. The risk of funds being moved 
directly or indirectly through or via the VI was Medium-High. Given the fact that the VI is an 
international financial and international financial centre, the risk of movement was given a 
greater weighting, leading to an overall risk rating of Medium-High. 
 
It was identified that the risk to the VI in relation to TF via is the misuse of VI legal entities is 
Medium-High. Secondly, the risk that the VI entities are used to facilitate the transfer of funds 
intended to be used for terrorism purposes abroad, particularly with funds/VAs being sent via 
 
120 FATF TF Risk Assessment Guidance 
121 | P a g e  
 
VI VASPs was found to be Medium-High. The risk that VI service providers such as TCSPs 
or lawyers may provide services (knowingly or unknowingly) to entities which are involved in 
TF is Medium-Low. The risk of the VI facilitating the movement through or from the VI of 
cash or PMS relevant to TF is Low. 
Annex I: Recommendations 
 
1. This Risk Assessment should be updated every three years to ensure that accurate and 
up-to-date data is considered and that changes in risks are recognised in good time and 
that appropriate mitigating measures can be taken.121  
 
2. In accordance with FATF Standards,122 the RA should be endorsed at the highest level 
and widely circulated across both public and private sectors to ensure a high level of 
the understanding of TF risk across the jurisdiction. 
 
3. Training on the findings of this RA should be provided to the public sector. 
 
4. Outreach should be conducted to the private sector regarding the findings of the RA in 
order that they may gain a better understanding of TF risk to allow for implementation 
of more effective controls and increase their ability to detect and prevent and mitigate 
potential TF activities. 
 
FIA - AIU 
5. Strategic analysis on the misuse of cash and cash intensive businesses should be 
considered. 
 
RVIPF Intelligence Unit 
6. RIVPF IU should be provided with training on terrorism, TF and red flags. 
 
121 The FATF Standards requires countries to maintain an up-to-date assessment of their TF risks. While a risk 
assessment presents a snapshot in time, an assessment of TF risk should be an ongoing and evolving process 
Jurisdiction experience highlights the particular benefits of embedding a culture of ongoing risk or threat 
assessment, having ongoing mechanisms to collect relevant information on TF risk, and conducting more targeted 
TF risk assessments which allow for enhanced stakeholder engagement. 
122 (Jurisdictions should ensure that the findings of the TF risk assessment are endorsed by senior officials, and 
that all key stakeholders have a common understanding of the outcomes and the relative measures of risk - FATF 
TF Risk Assessment Guidance, Part 5.  
122 | P a g e  
 
 
7. RVIPF IU should continue with plans to collect intelligence relating to transfers of 
funds via informal means, crypto currencies and the movement of goods (in conjunction 
with HMC).  
 
RVIPF-FCU 
 
8. Recruitment within the RVIPF-FCU of additional resources sufficiently skilled in the 
area of TF should be completed swiftly and additional resources that have been 
budgeted for implemented as soon as possible including training of investigators and 
IT resources particularly in the area of the investigation of VAs. 
 
9. The national strategy on investigations and prosecution of TF should be finalised and 
include all relevant agencies namely ODPP, FCU, RVIPF Intelligence, HMC, DOI and 
FIA-AIU as well as the regulators and relevant committees such as CLEA.  
 
10. International Cooperation LEA partnerships with regional and international 
enforcement agencies should continue to be enhanced. 
 
11. The FCU should continue to collect and consolidate information regarding TF risks and 
trends and provide updates at CLEA.  Outcomes should be monitored. 
 
HMC 
12. HMC should ensure that TF Risk is considered in the work being undertaken 
particularly regarding the cross-border movement of cash and goods, this could 
potentially be combined with the envisaged creation of a RA Unit and that HMC has 
sufficient staff to monitor the movement of cross-border cash and goods for TF risk.  
 
13. HMC training should be conducted in relation to the identification of TF in areas such 
as the movement of goods and precious metals. 
 
14. HMC should enhance the collection of information regarding the movement of PMS 
and monitor movement in and out of the territory.  
 
123 | P a g e  
 
CLEA 
15. Information sharing and communication should be enhanced bilaterally and committees 
such as CLEA Collaboration should be both at the strategic level as well as on 
individual matters at the operational level. 
 
 
FIA-SEU 
16. The FIA-SEU should ensure that DNFBPs it supervises conduct TF specific 
institutional RA to ensure that they have the relevant and adequate measure in place to 
mitigate any TF risk and more TF training be provided to management and staff.  
 
17. Employees of the FIA-SEU should undertake TF training.  
 
18. The FIA-SEU should provide targeted TFS outreach and guidance to the DNFBP sector, 
as well as conduct ongoing targeted TFS offsite and onsite examinations/inspections 
for the DNFBP sector. 
 
DOI 
19.  The DOI should enhance its data collection processes to facilitate more detailed 
demographic analysis and ensure better tracking of immigration trends. These measures 
will support proactive monitoring and contribute to a more comprehensive RA.  
 
20. DOI training should be conducted in identifying and responding to potential TF threats. 
 
 
FIA AIU 
21. The FIA AIU and FIA-SEU should collaborate to conduct strategic analysis reports on 
TF trends and typologies for the DNFBP sector.  
 
22. The FIA AIU should assess its increased capacity in relation to VA TF / TFS analysis, 
and proceed to ensure additional employees if needed, and ensure that analysts are 
engaged in ongoing TF updates that are applicable to TF e.g. moving funds through the 
territory.   
 
FSC 
124 | P a g e  
 
23. All VASP applications should be processed as a matter of urgency and registered 
VASPs closely monitored in relation to TF and TFS risk.  Policing the perimeter 
activities should continue to ensure that those VASPs whose applications are refused 
and continue to carry on business or those who commence operations in the VI prior to 
being registered are appropriately penalised in accordance with the legal requirements. 
 
Private Sector 
24. FIs’ and DNFBPs’ should ensure:  
a. Institutional risk assessments fully consider and account for TF risk exposure 
 
b. Staff are sufficiently trained to understand TF and the TF risk posed by their clients and 
their business activities 
 
 
c. Adequate verification and ongoing monitoring is conducted to ensure proper 
understanding of the nature of business and circumstances of clients to be able to 
identify potential changes that may signal possible TF activity 
 
d. Staff are adequately trained to identify suspicious activities related to TF  
 
Other 
25. In relation to LPLAs, the TF WG adopts the recommendations made in the LPLA RA: 
 
a. Implement more detailed and better representative statistics by LEAs to allow VI to 
more accurately assess the actual risks detected in relation to VI LPLAs. This should 
include maintaining easily retrievable statistics in relation to the different types of 
LPLAs featuring in a SAR or investigation, other involved jurisdictions, predicate 
offences and other features, including for example, the presence of nominee 
arrangements.  
 
b. Collect more data relating to LPLAs, including but not limited to nature of business 
(particularly business that is considered high risk for ML, TF and PF), extent of 
nominee shareholder arrangements and more detailed information on the use of 
introducers (for example, the nature of business of introducers and risk level assigned 
to the introducer).  
 
c. Identify and consider the risks of foreign legal arrangements that have sufficient links 
to the VI. 
 
125 | P a g e  
 
d. Ensure that all the elements of FATF Recommendations 24 and 25 are covered within 
VI legislation and implemented, particularly those relating to the collection and 
maintenance of accurate and up to date BO information. 
 
e. Once the BO registry for legal persons is established, ROCA should implement a risk-
based programme to verify the accuracy of the information in the registry.  
 
f. Once the BO registry is established, the ROCA should implement effective and 
dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with filing obligations, including false, 
incomplete or inaccurate filings. 
 
g. ROCA should ensure that all shareholder nominee arrangements for legal persons are 
registered in the corporate registry and impose penalties for non-compliance with this 
requirement.  
 
h. Improve compliance with AML/CFT/CPF requirements particularly for the legal and 
accounting professions through increased outreach, onsite inspections and sanctions for 
non-compliance, leading to increased compliance by entities, as evidenced in onsite 
inspections.  
 
i. Provide outreach to the regulated sector, primarily TCSPs, and legal and accounting 
professionals, on the risks relating to LPLAs in the VI and their role in mitigating that 
risk.  
 
j. Continue to develop and enhance understanding of risk of LPLAs through typologies 
and other means and sharing this information with the private sector on a regular basis 
through Joint Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Advisory Committee 
(JALTFAC), newsletter, outreach sessions and other fora. 
 
k. Regulators and LEAs to receive training on how VI LPLAS can be misused to commit 
the offences of ML, TF and PF. 123  
 
26. In relation to NPOs the TF WG adopts the recommendations made in the NPO RA: 
 
 
123 It must be acknowledged that VI has already started implementing stronger controls in relation to the risk posed 
by BVIBCs. In September 2024, amendments to legislation were passed in the House of Assembly that require 
legal persons to provide BO information to the ROCA and ensure this information is kept up to date.  This is in 
addition to the existing requirement to provide such information to their registered agent, which must be a licenced 
TCSP. These requirements came into force on January 2, 2025, and are in the process of being fully adopted. This 
new requirement to provide BO information to the ROCA. requires disclosure of corporate directors and nominee 
shareholders and imposes stronger recordkeeping measures on trusts. These measures, along with continued 
surveillance, guidance and outreach to the regulated sector to assist them with strengthening their compliance 
program will result in a reduced risk exposure for the VI once those improvements have been fully implemented. 
126 | P a g e  
 
a. The VI should take steps to promote focused, proportionate and risk-based oversight or 
monitoring of NPOs.  
 
b. Effective monitoring and supervision of higher risk NPOs should occur as well as 
developing the SOP for the CFT supervision of NPOs and undertaking periodic 
outreach and providing guidance.  
 
c. The NPO Board should update its manual system to ensure that information on NPOs 
is kept up to date, accurate and readily available upon request, particularly for 
investigative purposes and to facilitate international requests. 
 
d. Outreach to the Banking Sector as it pertains to TF risk to facilitate financial inclusion 
and reduce the occurrence of derisking within the NPO sector should be conducted. 
 
e. The NPO Board, the FIA and the FSC should implement procedures to facilitate 
effective sharing amongst each other in relation to registered and incorporated NPOs 
that are being struck off the register, dissolved, deregistered, sanctioned, or have 
changed their directors/BOs or structure.
