satisfies any of the requirements of sub-
regulation (3); 
 (ii) the Agency’s or the Commission’s approval of 
appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting

provision of the Act, the Code, these Regulations 
or any other enactment relating to money

against a Money Laundering Reporting Officer in 
accordance with the Financial Investigation Agency 
Act or the Financial Services Commission Act, Revised

approval of a person as a Money Laundering Reporting 
Officer is no longer in the public interest, 
it may issue a warning to, or suspend or withdraw the approval of 
appointment of, the Money Laundering Reporting Officer. 
 (13) The Agency or the Commission shall 
 
 
6 
 
(a) before suspending or withdrawing an approval under 
sub-regulation (12), indicate its intention to do so by

and 
(b) after the end of the notice period referred to in

suspend or withdraw the approval of appointment 
of, the Money Laundering Reporting Officer. 
 (14) Where the Agency or the Commission suspends the approval 
of appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Officer under sub-
regulation (12), the suspension shall be for an initial period not 
exceeding 30 days, which may be renewed for such further period not 
exceeding another 30 days.  
(15) For the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that the 
appointment of a person as a Money Laundering Reporting Officer is 
valid only  
(a) in relation to the relevant person that appointed him or 
her; and 
(b) for so long as he or she holds that office in or in 
relation to the relevant person. 
(16) Subject to sub-regulation (12), any person who was 
appointed and holds office as a Money Laundering Reporting Officer 
prior to the coming into force of these Regulations (Anti-money 
Laundering (Amendment) Regulations, 2024) shall, upon the coming 
into force of the Regulations continue to hold office as a Money 
Laundering Reporting Officer as if his or her appointment was approved 
in accordance with this regulation.”.
