PART VI 
MATERIAL ON WHICH DESIGNATIONS MAY BE BASED 
 
52.  
In considering whether to make or to revoke a designation under 
section 38 or section 40 or section 55, the Governor may take into account any 
relevant information, including classified security information. 
 
53. (1)  
In this Act, “classified security information” means information 
 
(a) 
relevant to whether there are or may be grounds for 
designating an identifiable entity under this Act as a terrorist 
entity or as an associated entity;  
 
(b)  
held by a specified agency; and 
 
(c)  
that the Head of the specified agency certifies in writing (in 
the prescribed form (if any)) that the information cannot be 
disclosed except to the extent provided in section 57 
because, in the opinion of the Head of the specified agency 
 
(i)  
the information is information of a kind specified in 
subsection (2); and 
 
(ii)  
disclosure of the information would be disclosure of 
a kind specified in subsection (3). 
 
(2)  
Information falls within subsection (1)(c)(i) if it  
Arms embargo 
Information 
available to 
Governor. 
Classified 
security 
information 
defined. 
 
47
 
(a)  
might lead to the identification of, or provide details of, the 
source of the information, the nature, content, or scope of 
the information, or the nature or type of the assistance or 
operational methods available to the specified agency;  
 
(b)  
is about particular operations that have been undertaken, or 
are being or are proposed to be undertaken, in pursuance of 
any of the functions of the specified agency; or 
 
(c)  
has been provided to the specified agency by the 
Government of another country or by an agency of a 
Government of another country or by an international 
organisation, and is information that cannot be disclosed by 
the specified agency because the government or agency or 
organisation by which the information has been provided 
will not consent to the disclosure. 
 
(3)  
Disclosure of information falls within subsection (1)(c)(ii) if the 
disclosure would be likely 
 
(a)  
to prejudice the security or defence of the Virgin Islands or 
the international relations of the Government of the Virgin 
Islands;  
 
(b)  
to prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government 
of the Virgin Islands on a basis of confidence by the 
Government of another country or any agency of such a 
Government, or by any international organisation;  
 
(c)  
to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the 
prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the 
right to a fair trial; or 
 
(d) 
to endanger the safety of any person. 
 
54.  
Nothing in this Act prevents a person from bringing any judicial 
review or other proceedings before a court arising out of, or relating to, the making 
of a designation under this Act. 
 
55. (1)  
The Governor may at any time revoke a designation made under 
section 38 or section 40, either on the Governor’s own initiative or on an

by a third party with an interest in the designation that, in 
the Governor’s opinion, is an interest apart from any interest 
in common with the public. 
 
(2)  
Without limiting subsection (1)(b), a party may have an interest in a 
designation apart from any interest in common with the public through 
 
(a)  
possessing or controlling, or having an interest in, property 
to which section 9 applies as a result of the designation;  
 
(b)  
making available property or services to which section 10 
applies as a result of the designation; or 
 
(c)  
having an especially close association with the designated 
terrorist entity or its interests or objectives. 
 
(3)   
Subject to subsection (4), an application under subsection (1) for 
revocation of a designation shall be based on the grounds: - 
 
(a)  
that the designation should not stand because the entity 
concerned does not satisfy the test stated in section 38(1) or 
(3) or, as the case requires, in section 40(1) or (3); or 
 
(b)  
that the entity concerned is no longer involved in any way in 
acts of the kind that made, or that would make, the entity 
eligible for designation. 
 
(4)   
The Governor may not refuse an application to revoke a designation 
under section 38 or section 40 without having first consulted with the Attorney 
General about the proposed refusal. 
 
(5)  
Except as provided in subsection (4), subsection (1) overrides every 
other provision of this Act. 
 
56. (1)  
A designation under section 40 expires 3 years after the date on 
which it takes effect, unless it is earlier 
 
(a)  
revoked under section 55; or 
 
(b)  
renewed by an order under subsection (2) or (3). 
 
(2)  
The Governor may order that a designation made under section 40 
remain in force for a further 3 years after the making of the order if the Governor is 
satisfied that there are still reasonable grounds as set out in section 40 for an entity 
to be designated under that section.

may make another order renewing the designation concerned for a further 3 years. 
 
(4)  
After making an order under subsection (2) or (3), the Governor 
shall report to the National Security Council on the renewal of the designation. 
 
(5)  
The Governor may make any number of orders under subsection (3) 
in respect of the same designation.

relating to, the making of a designation under this Act. 
 
(2)

responded to by all parties to the proceedings). 
 
(3)  
If information presented, or proposed to be presented, by the Crown 
includes classified security information 
 
(a)  
except where proceedings are before the Court of Appeal, 
the proceedings shall be heard and determined by a Judge; 
and  
 
(b)  
the court shall, on a request for the purpose by the Attorney 
General, and if satisfied that it is desirable to do so for the 
protection of either all or part of the classified security 
information, receive or hear the relevant part or all of the 
classified security information in the absence of 
 
(i)  
the designated terrorist entity concerned; and 
 
(ii)  
all legal practitioners, if any, representing that entity; 
and 
 
(iii)  
members of the public. 
 
(4)  
Without limiting subsection (3), if the designated terrorist entity 
concerned participates in proceedings

the court shall approve a summary of the information of the 
kind referred to in section 53(2) that is presented by the 
Attorney General except to the extent that a summary of any 
particular part of the information would itself involve

another person is engaged in the financing of terrorism; or 
  
(b)

offence to which this Act applies.  
 
“relevant day” means the first day of the period of six years ending with – 
(a)  
the day when proceedings for the terrorist offence concerned were 
started against the defendant; or 
(b)

were started on different days, the earliest of those days. 
87.(1)  
The court shall proceed under this section if the following 
conditions are satisfied 
 
(a) 
the defendant has been convicted of an offence or 
offences under this Act;  
 
(b) 
the Crown asks the court to proceed under this Part; 
or 
 
(c) 
the court believes it is appropriate for it to do so. 
 
(2)  
The court shall proceed as follows: 
 
(a) 
it must determine whether the defendant has committed a 
terrorist offence under this Act, including the commission of 
or any involvement in one or more terrorist acts, the 
handling or possession of terrorist property and the 
financing of terrorism; and 
 
(b) 
whether he has benefited from such terrorist offence. 
 
(3)  
The court must decide these issues on a balance of probabilities. 
 
(4)  
If the court determines under subsection (2)(b) that the defendant 
has benefited from a terrorist offence under this Act it must: – 
 
(a) 
determine the recoverable amount,  
 
(b) 
exclude in the determination any property that is subject to a 
cash forfeiture order or a forfeiture order under the Proceeds 
of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997, the Drug Trafficking 
Offences Act, 1992, or any other enactment; and 
 
Making of Order. 
 
72
(c) 
make a confiscation order requiring him to pay that amount, 
to the extent that it would not be disproportionate to require 
the defendant to pay the recoverable amount. 
 
(5)  
The court must treat the duty in subsection (4) as a power if it 
believes that any person has at any time started or intends to start proceedings 
against the defendant in respect of loss, injury or damage sustained in connection 
with or as a result of a terrorist offence. 
 
(6)  
For the purposes of this Part, a person benefits from a terrorist 
offence if he obtains terrorist property as a result of or in connection with its 
commission and his benefit is the value of the property so obtained. 
 
(7)  
Where a person derives a pecuniary advantage as a result of or in 
connection with the commission of a terrorist offence, he is to be treated for the 
purposes of this Act, as if he had obtained as a result of or in connection with the 
commission of the terrorist offence a sum of money equal to the value of the 
pecuniary advantage. 
 
88. (1) 
The recoverable amount for the purposes of section 87(4) is an 
amount equal to the defendant’s benefit from the terrorist offence concerned.  
 
(2)  
The court upon determining the defendant’s benefit, may, after 
giving a sentence for offences under this Act, make an order for the defendant to 
pay an amount that represents a part of or the entire benefit to the court, to be paid 
within a specified time as stated by the court.  
 
(3)  
An order to pay confiscation is separate and apart from any fine 
that may be made as a part of sentencing. 
 
(4)  
If any sum required to be paid by a person under a confiscation 
order, whether forthwith or within a specified period, is not paid, that person is 
liable to pay interest on the sum for the period for which it remains unpaid. 
 
(5)  
The amount of the interest referred to in subsection (4) shall be 
treated as part of the amount to be recovered from the person liable to pay interest 
under the confiscation order. 
 
(6)  
The rate of interest to be paid under subsection (4) shall be that 
applicable to a civil judgment debt under section 7 of the Judgments Act.

(a) 
there is property held by the defendant that is likely to be 
realised or otherwise used to satisfy the order; and

interests. 
 
 
73
(b) 
a person other than the defendant holds, or may hold, an 
interest in the property,  
 
the court may, if it thinks it appropriate to do so, determine the extent (at the time 
the confiscation order is made) of the defendant’s interest in the property.  
 
(2) 
The court must not exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) 
unless it gives to anyone who the court thinks is or may be a person holding an 
interest in the property a reasonable opportunity to make representations to it.  
 
(3) 
A determination under this section is conclusive in relation to any 
question as to the extent of the defendant’s interest in the property that arises in 
connection with 
 
(a) 
the realisation of the property, or the transfer of an interest 
in the property, with a view to satisfying the confiscation 
order; or 
 
(b) 
any action or proceedings taken for the purposes of any 
such realisation or transfer.  
 
(4) 
Subsection (3) does not apply or bind the court 
 
(a) 
if the person holding an interest in the property was not 
given a reasonable opportunity to make representations 
when the determination was made and has not appealed 
against the determination; or  
 
(b) 
where it appears to the court that there would be a serious 
risk of injustice to the person if the court was bound by the 
determination.  
 
(5) 
Further, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a question that 
arises in proceedings before the Court of Appeal or the High Court.  
 
(6) 
In this section, the “extent” of the defendant’s interest in property 
means the proportion that the value of the defendant’s interest in it bears to the 
value of the property itself.  
 
(7)  Any person, other than the defendant who holds, or may hold, an 
interest in the property, who has not been charged or sentenced with any offence 
under this Act may apply to the court to alter the recoverable amount to preserve 
their interest.  
 
(8) 
 The person making the application under subsection (7) must 
prove on the balance of probabilities that the benefit to not be applied to the 
 
74
recoverable amount is not the result of a terrorist offence under this Act or any 
other offence.  
 
(9)  No entity who is the subject of the designation concerned may 
make an application under this section. 
 
90. (1) 
This section applies if the court 
 
(a) 
is considering whether to make a determination under 
section 89 of the extent of the defendant’s interest in any 
property; or  
 
(b) 
is deciding what determination to make (if the court has 
decided to make a determination under section 89). 
 
(2)  
For the purposes of this section “interested person” means a person 
(other than the defendant) who the court thinks is or may be a person holding an 
interest in the property.  
 
(3)  
For the purpose of obtaining information to help it in carrying out 
its functions under section 86, the court may at any time order an interested 
person to give it information specified in the order.  
 
(4)  
An order under this section may require all or a specified part of 
the information to be given in a specified manner and before a specified date.  
 
(5)  
If an interested person fails without reasonable excuse to comply 
with an order under this section, the court may draw such inference as it believes 
is appropriate.  
 
(6)  
Subsection (5) does not affect any power of the court to deal with 
the person in respect of a failure to comply with an order under this section.  
 
(7)  
If the prosecutor accepts to any extent an allegation made by an 
interested person 
 
(a) 
in giving information required by an order under this 
section; or 
 
(b) 
in any other statement given to the court in relation to any 
matter relevant to a determination under section 89,  
 
the court may treat the acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates.  
 
 
(8)  
For the purposes of this section, an allegation may be accepted in a 
manner ordered by the court.

information as 
to defendant’s

property

vary it by making another one.  
 
 
(10)

in evidence in proceedings against that person for an offence.

If the court makes a confiscation order, the defendant may appeal to 
the Court of Appeal in respect of the order. 
 
(2)  
If the court decides not to make a confiscation order, the Crown 
may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision. 
 
92. (1)  
On an appeal under subsection 91(1) the Court of Appeal may 
confirm, quash or vary the confiscation order. 
 
(2)  
On an appeal under subsection 91(2) the Court of Appeal may 
confirm the decision, or if it believes the decision was wrong it may 
(a)  
itself proceed under section 87 (ignoring the conditions 
under subsection 87(1)); or 
(b)  
direct the court to proceed afresh under section 87. 
(3)  
In proceeding afresh in pursuance of this section the court must 
comply with any directions the Court of Appeal may make. 
(4)

pursuance of a direction under this Part it must have regard to any fine imposed on 
the defendant in respect of the terrorist offence (or any of the terrorist offences) 
concerned. 
(5)  
If an order has been made against the defendant in respect of the

PART 1 
 
FORFEITURE OF TERRORIST CASH 
 
 
1. (1)  
This Schedule applies to cash identified as terrorist cash.  
 
(2) 
For the purposes of this paragraph 
 
“terrorist cash” means cash which 
 
(a) 
is intended to be used for the purposes of terrorist financing 
or one or more terrorist acts; or 
 
(b) 
is, or represents, property obtained through terrorist acts.  
 
 
PART 2 
 
SEIZURE AND DETENTION OF TERRORIST CASH 
 
2. (1) 
For the purposes of this paragraph 
 
(a) 
“cash” includes coins, notes in any currency, cheques and 
any other monetary or type of bearer negotiable instrument; 
 
(b) 
“customs officer” means an officer appointed under section 
6 of the Customs Ordinance;  
 
(c) 
“police officer” includes the Director and an investigating 
officer of the Financial Investigation Agency established 
under section 3(1) of the Financial Investigation Agency 
Act; and  
 
(2) 
A police officer or a customs officer may seize any cash if he has 
reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is terrorist cash. 
 
3. (1) 
Cash seized by virtue of paragraph 2(2) shall not be detained for 
more than 72 hours, unless its continued detention is authorised by order of a 
Magistrate upon an application made by a police officer or the Commissioner of 
Customs. 
 
140 
 
(2) 
A Magistrate shall not make an order under paragraph 3(1), unless 
he is satisfied 
 
(a) 
that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion 
mentioned in paragraph 2(2); and 
 
(b) 
that continued detention of the cash is justified while its 
origin or derivation is further investigated, or consideration 
is given to the institution (whether in the Territory or 
elsewhere) of criminal proceedings against any person for 
an offence with which the cash is connected; or  
 
(c) 
that proceedings against any person for an offence with 
which the cash is connected have been started but have not 
been concluded.  
 
4. Where an order is made under paragraph 3(1), the Magistrate 
 
(a) 
shall provide for notice to be given to persons affected by it 
and the notice shall be in such form as the Magistrate shall 
determine, unless otherwise provided in rules made under 
the Magistrate’s Code of Procedure Act;  
 
(b) 
shall authorise the continued detention of the cash to which 
the order relates for a period, not exceeding 3 months 
beginning with the date of the order, as may be specified in 
the order; and  
 
(c) 
may thereafter, if satisfied as to the matters mentioned in 
the application under paragraph 3(1), from time to time by 
order authorise the further detention of the cash, but so that 
 
(i) 
no period of detention specified in such an order 
shall exceed 3 months beginning with the date of the 
order; and  
 
(ii) 
the total period of detention shall not exceed 2 years 
from the date of the order.  
 
5. 
At any time while cash is detained by virtue of paragraph 2(2) 
 
(a) 
the Magistrate may direct its release if satisfied, on an 
application made: - 
 
 
141 
(i) 
by the person from whom it was seized or a person 
by or on whose behalf it was being imported or 
exported, that there are no, or are no longer any, 
such grounds as are mentioned in paragraph 3(2) to 
warrant its continued detention; or  
 
(ii) 
by any other person, that the continued detention of 
the cash is not for that or any other reason justified; 
and  
 
(b) 
The Commissioner of Police or the Commissioner of 
Customs shall, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, 
make an application to the Magistrate to have detained cash 
released once it has been determined that continued 
detention is no longer justified.  
 
6. 
A police officer or the Commissioner of Customs shall not release 
detained cash unless he first notifies 
 
(a) 
the Magistrate under whose order the cash is being 
detained; or 
 
(b) 
another Magistrate in the absence of the one under whose 
order the cash is being detained.  
 
7. 
Where on an application under paragraph 5 for the release of cash 
that is being detained the Magistrate finds that only a part of the cash, if it relates 
to liquid currency, is intended for use by a terrorist, the Magistrate may order the 
release of that part of the cash as does not relate to the intended terrorist act or 
financing of terrorism.  
 
8. 
If at any time when any cash is being detained by virtue of 
paragraph 2(2) 
 
(a) 
an application for its forfeiture is made under paragraph 9; 
or  
 
(b) 
proceedings are instituted (whether in the Virgin Islands or 
elsewhere) against any person for an offence with which 
the cash is connected,  
 
the cash shall not be released until any proceedings pursuant to the application or, 
as the case may be, the proceedings for that offence have been concluded.  
 
 
 
 
142 
 
 
Forfeiture 
 
9. (1) 
A Magistrate may order the forfeiture to the Crown of the whole or 
any part of cash which has been seized pursuant to paragraph 2(2) if he is 
satisfied, on an application made by a police officer or the Commissioner of 
Customs, that the cash is terrorist cash.  
 
(2) 
The standard of proof in proceedings on an application under 
paragraph 9(1) shall be on a balance of probability.  
 
(3) 
An order may be made under paragraph 9(1) irrespective of 
whether proceedings are brought against a person for an offence with which the 
cash in question is connected.  
 
(4) 
Where an application for the forfeiture of any cash is made under 
paragraph 9(1), the cash is to be detained (and may not be released under any 
power conferred under Part 2 of this Schedule) until any proceedings in pursuance 
of the application, including any proceedings on appeal, are concluded.  
 
(5) 
Any party to proceedings under this section who is aggrieved by an 
order of the Magistrate may, within 30 days from the date on which the order is 
made, appeal to the Court of Appeal, which may make such order as it thinks 
appropriate.  
 
Interest 
 
10. 
Cash seized pursuant to paragraph 2(2) and detained for more than 
72 hours shall, unless required as evidence of an offence, be held in an interest-
bearing account and the interest accruing on any such cash shall be added to that 
cash on its forfeiture or release.  
 
Immunity from suit 
 
11. 
No action shall be brought against any police officer or customs 
officer for anything done, in good faith, in exercise of the powers conferred on 
him by this Schedule.
