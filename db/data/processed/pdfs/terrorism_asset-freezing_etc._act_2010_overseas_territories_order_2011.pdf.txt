SCHEDULE 3
Article 3(2)
Modifications additionally to be made in the extensions of the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act
2010 to the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends Part 1 (including Part 1 of Schedule 2) of the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act
2010 to the British overseas territories (“the Territories”) specified in Schedule 1, subject to the
modifications specified in Schedule 2 of this Order and additionally in Schedule 3 for the Sovereign
Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
The Order replaces the existing power that the Territories have to freeze the assets of those suspected
of being involved in terrorism under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Overseas Territories)
Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3366) which is vulnerable to being quashed following the Supreme Court
decision in Ahmed & Ors v HM Treasury [2010] UKSC 2. Applying Part 1 of the 2010 Act to the
Territories will give them a similar power to the Treasury’s powers under the Terrorist Asset Freezing
etc. Act 2010, allowing them to make asset freezes, licence exemptions, and to require and share
information within their own territories.
The United Kingdom has an obligation to provide penalties for offences enforcing Regulation (EC)
No. 2580/2001 (OJ No.L344,28.12.2001 p.70). This is provided for in section 1(b) Part 1 of the Asset
Freezing etc. Act 2010. The Territories have no such obligation to provide penalties so section 1(b)
is not one of the provisions in Part 1 extended to the Territories.
