FATF Public Statement – December 2020 
 
FATF removes The Bahamas from the list of Jurisdictions under 
Increased Monitoring 
 
On 18 December 2020, The FATF removed The Bahamas from the list of Jurisdictions under Increased 
Monitoring.  
The FATF recognised The Bahamas for the significant progress it has made in improving its AML/CFT 
regime, noting that The Bahamas has strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT system and 
addressed related technical deficiencies which allowed it to meet the commitments in its action plan 
and remedy the strategic deficiencies identified by the FATF in October 2018. 
 
The Bahamas is therefore no longer subject to the FATF’s increased monitoring process. The Bahamas 
will continue to work with CFATF to further improve its AML/CFT regime.
