INTRODUCTION  
 
In order to comply with Recommendation 1 of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) 
International Standards on Combatting Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism 
and Proliferation, which requires countries to identify, assess and understand the money 
laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks and apply a risk-based approach to prevent 
or mitigate ML and TF, the Virgin Islands (VI) determined that the most efficient way to 
complete this task was by completing a National Risk Assessment (NRA). The NRA exercise, 
which commenced in September 2014, was concluded in 2016, after the Cabinet of the VI 
approved the Virgin Islands National Risk Assessment Report (NRAR) 2016. 
 
The purpose of the NRA was to assess ML/TF/Proliferation Financing (PF) risks to the VI to assist 
with the targeted application of a risk-based approach to Anti-Money Laundering 
(AML)/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). It was concluded that the completion of 
an NRA would assist the Territory with identifying and assessing its risks with regard to ML/TF, 
and the results of the NRA would provide a clear picture of which Competent Authorities 
(CAs), Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and sectors were most vulnerable to ML/TF. 
 
The NRA was geared toward identifying the Territory’s ML and TF risks and determining where 
resources were to be allocated based on the identified risks. It further provided the 
opportunity to identify required changes to the current AML/CFT regime based on these 
identified risks. The initial NRA covered the period of 2011 – 2014, inclusive of identified threats 
and vulnerabilities for a range of agencies and sectors including all of the Territory’s CAs and 
LEAs, which are the focus of this progress report. The responsibility for ensuring the 
recommendations identified in the NRAR for Financial Institutions (FIs), Designated Non-
Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) and Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) are being 
implemented, lies with the relevant regulators, i.e., the Financial Services Commission (FSC) 
and the Financial Investigation Agency (FIA). 
 
To assist with the implementation of the NRA Recommendations, the AML/CFT 
Implementation Unit (The Unit) was created within the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The main 
focus of The Unit is to undertake and ensure effective implementation of the NRA 
Recommendations. After the completion of the NRAR in 2016, the Territory was faced with 
the passage of two devastating hurricanes in 2017, which not only damaged the 
infrastructure of the VI, but hindered the progress of the implementation of the 
recommendations outlined in the NRAR. This notwithstanding, The Unit continued to work with 
the relevant agencies to ensure the continued implementation of the NRA 
Recommendations.  
 
The first progress report on the implementation of the NRA Recommendations was 
completed by The Unit in 2018. This report outlined the progress of the following agencies 
with regard to their individual NRA Recommendations: 
 
Governor’s Office 
 
Attorney General’s Chambers 
 
Financial Investigation Agency 
 
Financial Services Commission 
 
Magistrate’s Court 
 
Immigration Department 
 
Her Majesty’s Customs 
 
Royal Virgin Islands Police Force 
 
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions 
 
BVI Airports Authority 
 
BVI Ports Authority 
 
This second and final report now includes progress relative to two additional agencies, High 
(Supreme) Court and the International Tax Authority. 
 
Since 2018, The Unit has worked closely with the relevant agencies to assist with the 
implementation of the NRA recommendations. Most of the LEAs and CAs have made 
significant improvements to the NRA Recommendations. The VI has decided to undertake an 
update of its AML/CFT risks by undertaking separate ML and TF Sectoral Risk Assessments for 
FIs and DNFBPs. Consequently, this report will form the final official update on the 
implementation of the recommendations emanating out of the NRAR. The Unit will continue 
to monitor and measure the effectiveness of each CA and LEA in forestalling ML/TF and 
mitigating the risks emanating from all related crimes. 
 
 
GRADING SCHEME 
 
A grading scheme of four levels was used to assess the status of the recommendations for 
each of the LEAs and CAs within this report. The grading scheme is broken down as follows:

COMPETENT AUTHORITIES 
 
This Section provides a progress report on the five competent authorities of the VI. It displays 
a synopsis on the progress of the recommendations and the current status of each 
recommendation. The Competent Authorities are as follows: 
 
Governor’s Office 
 
Attorney General’s Chambers 
 
Financial Investigation Agency 
 
Financial Services Commission 
 
International Tax Authority 
 
 
GOVERNOR’S OFFICE (GO) 
 
The following risk areas were identified within the GO in the 2016 NRAR: 
High Risk 
 
Handling of incoming extradition requests 
 
Handling of outgoing extradition requests 
Medium Risk 
 
Inter-agency cooperation 
 
Handling of incoming MLA requests from foreign CAs 
 
Records maintenance and accessibility 
Low Risk 
 
Governance and administration 
 
Handling of complaints filed by foreign CAs 
 
Handling of complaints filed by GO 
 
The GO addressed a number of deficiencies necessary for it to be effective in the fight 
against ML/TF/PF. The recommendations identified in the NRAR in relation to records 
management, employee training, Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requests and extraditions 
have been significantly addressed. The GO has established direct communication and liaises 
on a regular basis with the Financial Investigation Agency (FIA), Office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), which makes 
responses to MLAs and extraditions more timely.  
 
It is important that the GO in collaboration with the FSC, AGC and FIA ensures there is proper 
communication and coordination in terms of extraditions, sanctions and MLA requests. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The GO should develop a corrective action plan to mitigate 
the deficiencies identified. This plan should include measures 
that ensures continuous management and monitoring of the 
corrective actions. The implementation of the plan should be 
monitored by carrying out internal audits on the established 
policies and procedures. 
Complete 
b) MLA requests should be tracked separately from extradition 
requests. This would enable better tracking of each and allow 
for easy generation of statistics. In addition, domestic 
Complete

extradition requests should be separately and properly 
logged. 
c) The GO should assess the current methods and channels of 
communication with the AGC with a view to ensuring clear 
and consistent communication. 
Largely Complete 
d) The GO and AGC should develop a procedural manual that 
stipulates their roles and responsibilities in relation to the 
receipt, processing and dissemination of information for MLAs 
and extraditions; this should include an assessment of the 
relevant legislative provisions to ensure consistency and avoid 
conflict. 
Complete 
e) The GO, in conjunction with the AGC, should develop and 
implement a procedure that can provide clear guidance on 
how to deal with extradition matters; this should include a 
step-by-step process with realistic timeframes to help guide 
the process from the receipt of an extradition request to the 
disposal of the request. 
Complete 
f) 
The record keeping system presently in place (as it relates to 
information pertaining to MLA and extradition) needs to be 
thoroughly assessed for areas of vulnerability and a proper 
record management system be put in place. 
Largely Complete 
g) A procedures manual on record keeping should be 
developed and implemented to provide clear guidance to 
staff within the GO. 
Complete 
h) Staff of the GO should be informed of, and trained on, their 
roles and responsibilities as they relate to record keeping and 
the risks associated with poor record keeping. The 
performance of their roles and responsibilities should form a 
part of their employee performance appraisal, where 
applicable. 
Largely Complete 
i) 
While the ‘clear desk’ policy might be good office practice, 
the GO should implement a document and records control 
system that is more secure and has, amongst other features, a 
control mechanism in place to closely track all access 
granted to, and the location of, each file. 
Complete 
j) 
The GO, FIA and the AGC should reconcile any anomalies 
that exist between their records on extraditions and MLAs. 
These offices should institute periodic meetings (every quarter 
for example) to discuss and address any such anomalies and 
also verify and better streamline their mutual records and thus 
ensure a continuous efficient and effective system in relation 
to MLAs and extraditions.  
Largely Complete 
k) To ensure that consistency prevails, Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) (embodying policies) should be 
developed to provide guidance for staff. These procedures 
should clearly demarcate tasks to be performed by the GO 
so that the staff are certain with regard to their specific areas 
of assignment. The development of these procedures will 
assist in safeguarding against haphazard decision making 
and ensure clear actions are taken. 
 
The SOPs should communicate: 
 
Purpose 
 
Scope 
 
Roles and responsibilities 
 
Procedures (steps to be taken) 
Complete 
l) 
The GO should ensure that relevant Sanctions Orders and 
designations are communicated to the FIA and the Financial 
Services Commission (FSC) without delay to avoid business 
relationships with sanctioned or designated persons being 
continued or entered into on account of failure of timely 
knowledge of the sanctions or designations. 
Complete 
m) The GO should issue public guidance outlining the 
circumstances under which a license must be applied for if 
conducting business with, for, or on behalf of or in relation to 
a listed person subject to sanctions. 
Largely Complete 
n) Training should be provided to the staff of the GO on the 
extradition processes and procedures, including MLA and 
AML/CFT matters. This training may be limited to staff that 
deal with matters of extraditions, MLA and sanctions to 
strengthen their knowledge and awareness on the subject 
matters. 
Largely Complete 
o) The GO should assess the training needs of employees 
against the requirements of their job positions and the 
functions of the GO generally and make provision for the 
employees to receive the relevant training in AML/CFT and, 
where necessary, on a regular or periodic basis. 
Largely Complete 
p) The GO should conduct a comprehensive assessment of the 
present security measures that are in place to identify areas 
of vulnerabilities. Some questions to consider are: 
 
What kind of security systems and controls are 
currently being utilized? 
 
Does the GO have any security policies and 
procedures in place? 
 
Are these policies and procedures adequate and 
enforced? 
 
Do the current security systems and controls, policies 
and procedures reduce the risk of potential 
vulnerabilities? 
Complete 
q) The GO should issue access control picture identification 
badges, with the most recent photograph of the badge 
holder, to all employees. 
Complete 
r) 
The GO should assign temporary passes to visitors, who should 
be required to sign in and out of the GO premises. 
Complete 
s) The GO should review periodically and, where necessary, 
upgrade the perimeter intercoms and close circuit monitoring 
devices. 
Complete 
t) 
The GO should, at the very least, have a security guard at the 
main entrance to the office building with a clear view of the 
controlled areas. 
Complete 
u) The GO should develop a corrective action plan to mitigate 
the deficiencies (risks and vulnerabilities) identified in the 
NRAR. This plan should also include measures that would 
enable continuous effective management and monitoring of 
the measures currently in place to prevent any otherwise 
avoidable shortcoming. The implementation of the corrective 
action plan should be monitored carefully by the GO 
(preferably by a designated functionary within the GO) by 
carrying out internal audits on a periodic basis. 
Complete 
v) The Governor should consider the possibility of bringing the 
MC under the direct purview of the Chief Justice thereby 
eliminating any perceived conflict with or interference of the 
No Progress Made 
executive branch of government; this will align with what 
currently happens in most judicial systems around the 
Commonwealth and, in particular, most of the OECS 
countries. 
Terrorist and Proliferation Financing Recommendation 
w) The GO should be provided immediate training in TF.

They have implemented the post of International Relations Counsel to assist on all matters 
related to the external affairs of the Virgin Islands. The Solicitor General is now the primary 
contact for MLAT matters. 
 
The AGC should continue implementation and demonstrating that it is effectively 
implementing its AML/CFT obligations through, amongst other things, ensuring, as far as it is 
within their control, that legislation is passed timelier so as to keep up with the advancing 
world and the changes to different international standards. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The record keeping system presently in place (as it relates to 
information pertaining to MLA and extradition) needs to be

the maintenance of records that are easily accessible and 
retrievable whenever required. 
b) A procedures manual on record keeping should be 
implemented to provide clear guidance to staff. 
Largely Complete 
c) The AGC and GO should develop procedures that would 
stipulate their roles and responsibilities as they pertain to the 
receipt, processing and dissemination of information for MLA 
requests and extraditions. 
Complete 
d) The AGC should develop and implement procedures that 
provide clear guidance on how to deal with extradition 
matters, especially if the process varies per country. 
Complete 
e) The AGC should assess the training needs of its key 
employees against the requirements of their job positions and 
make provision for them to receive training in AML/CFT 
matters, as well as training that is specific to extradition, MLA 
and sanctions matters so as to strengthen their knowledge, 
skill and awareness on the subjects. 
Largely Complete 
f) 
The AGC should take steps to ensure that subsidiary legislation 
is drafted and enacted to remove specific designations of 
countries in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act (DTOA), 
Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act (PCCA) and Criminal 
Justice (International Cooperation Act (CJ(IC)A) to ensure 
that assistance could be provided to all requesting countries. 
Complete 
g) The current methods and channels of communication 
between the AGC and the GO should be reviewed to put in 
place appropriate systems that ensure full cooperation and 
certainty in dealing with or relating to each other. 
Largely Complete 
h) As a contingency, the AGC and GO should reconcile 
anomalies that exist between their records in order to ensure 
synergy in or in relation to common matters. In this regard, 
both offices should consider meeting periodically (at least 
every quarter in the first instance) to resolve these matters 
and ensure a continuing process of dialogue and comparing 
of notes to ensure accurate records on common areas of 
cooperation. 
Largely Complete 
i) 
The AGC should seek to develop informal bilateral relations or 
discussions with the countries to which they intend to seek an 
extradition of a fugitive to establish what is required of them in 
order to ensure that appropriate and correct requests are 
made to comply with the requirements of those countries. 
Similarly, they should review extradition requests carefully and 
thoroughly and, if need be, liaise with the requesting 
authorities submitting extradition requests to ensure that all 
required information is supplied to ensure a “smooth” 
execution of their requests. 
Partially Complete 
j) 
The AGC should conduct a comprehensive review of the 
present security measures which must, at the minimum, 
address the following and assess their efficiency and 
effectiveness: 
 
The type and adequacy of the security systems and 
controls presently engaged; 
 
The security policies and procedures in place and 
how best the inadequacies or shortcomings relative 
thereto may be properly addressed; 
 
How current security policies and procedures are 
enforced; and 
Partially Complete 
 
The level of understanding by staff of the AGC 
regarding the security measures and whether the 
need arises to put in place further restrictions on 
access to the building accommodating the AGC. 
k) The AGC should issue picture identification access control 
badges to all employees and consider requiring an annual 
reissuance to ensure security details are kept up to date. 
Partially Complete 
l) 
The AGC should assign temporary passes to visitors, who 
should be required to sign in and out of the AGC building. 
Partially Complete 
m) Considering that the building accommodating the AGC is 
shared with the ODPP, both offices should adopt measures 
whereby visitors are physically accompanied into staff offices 
and other areas of the building. 
Complete 
n) The AGC should take immediate steps to either repair or 
replace the current Arch Metal Detector. They should also 
develop contingency plans to address any shortcomings in 
the proper and efficient functioning of the Arch Metal 
Detector (for example, consideration may be given to the 
use of a handheld metal detector). In addition, they should 
establish an emergency evacuation plan that can be 
activated during bomb and other human related threats and 
natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and fires. 
Largely Complete 
o) The AGC should seek a better and more suitable storage 
facility not prone to the growth of mildew and mold for its 
archived files. 
Complete 
p) Appropriate security systems or procedures should be 
developed in relation to archived files by “severely” restricting 
access by persons not connected to and authorized by a 
designated senior officer of the AGC. Files that are severely 
affected by mildew or mold and/or which may pose a health 
hazard to staff should be transferred to and held in an 
electronic system to be maintained by the AGC and the 
physical files appropriately disposed of. 
Partially Complete 
q) While it is understood that it may not be financially feasible for 
the AGC to have an independent Information Technology (IT) 
system to run its operations, the AGC should liaise with the 
Department of Information Technology (DoIT) to improve the 
current authorization level for remote access to the AGC 
database by incorporating a password or access code. 
Whenever there is a need for DoIT to remotely access the 
AGC’s computers (for good reason), the AGC should be 
required to enter a password or access code that would be a 
sign of their approval to grant DoIT access to its computers. 
The password should only be given to select managers within 
the AGC, which should be reviewed from time to time and, 
where considered necessary, restricted.

r) 
An Orderly should be assigned to the Attorney General (AG) 
without delay. 
No Progress Made 
s) The AGC should assign sufficient resources and implement 
appropriate procedures to ensure that all MLA requests are 
responded to in a timely manner and to decrease the 
number of days it takes to respond to a request. In order to 
facilitate this, the AG should take immediate action, in liaison 
with the relevant authorities in Government, including the 
Governor and the Deputy Governor, who should lend 
maximum support to fill the vacant positions in the AGC. 
Largely Complete 
t) 
The AGC and ODPP should develop close cooperation 
measures (which should be outlined in writing) with each 
other in order to ensure the proper, efficient and effective 
processing of MLA and extradition matters; In addition, the 
AGC should assist the ODPP in carrying forward appropriate 
legislative reforms identified and/or recommended by the 
ODPP with a view to improving or facilitating the successful 
prosecution of ML/TF cases. 
Partially Complete 
u) The AGC should develop a corrective action plan to mitigate 
the deficiencies (risks and vulnerabilities) identified in the 
NRAR. This plan should also include measures that would 
enable continuous effective management and monitoring of 
the measures currently in place to prevent any otherwise 
avoidable shortcoming. The implementation of the corrective 
action plan should be monitored carefully by the AGC 
(preferably by a designated functionary within the AGC) by 
carrying out internal audits on a periodic basis. 
Complete 
Freezing, Seizures Confiscation and Forfeiture Recommendations 
v) The AGC, GO and ODPP should each ensure that their 
records in relation to confiscation, seizure, freezing, forfeiture 
and restraint are properly maintained and accurately reflect 
their specific roles, including in relation to common matters. 
Partially Complete 
w) The AGC should review its internal policies with a view to 
ensuring greater assistance to foreign CAs with respect to 
their requests for Court Orders on freezing, confiscations, 
forfeitures and restraints, including MLA matters generally; 
where requests for assistance fail to meet the threshold to 
submit an application to the Court, efforts should be 
expended in facilitating the requests as far as possible by fully 
engaging the foreign requesting authorities to provide 
necessary additional information or to modify their initial 
requests to meet the required threshold. 
Partially Complete 
Terrorist and Proliferation Financing Recommendations 
x) The current PF legislation is 6 years old and does not cover 
some of the elements listed in Recommendation 7 of the FATF 
Recommendations. It would be prudent, therefore, for the 
legislation to be reviewed and amendments made, where 
necessary, to bring it into line with the current FATF 
requirements on PF. 
Largely Complete 
y) In reviewing the legislation, consideration should be given to 
allowing directions to be issued by the FIA where the 
development, production or facilitation of such development 
or production of WMDs poses a threat to any country outside 
the current limitation of the VI and the UK.

The FIA has undertaken significant outreach and monitoring of the DNFBP and NPO sectors. 
With the implementation of a Compliance Manual Checklist and Risk Matrices, the FIA has 
been diligent in applying a risk-based approach towards the respective sectors. The FIA has 
worked diligently on increasing its staff complement to undertake the increasing number of 
tasks, particularly with the analysis of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)/Suspicious Transaction 
Reports (STRs) and inspections. The budget of the FIA is a limiting factor, which needs to be 
addressed to assist in the completion of its tasks. FIA should take steps to further demonstrate 
effectiveness as a supervisor by increasing its implementation of risk-based, desk-based and 
on-site inspection measures.  
 
As an FIU, the FIA also needs to take steps to demonstrate that it timely and adequately 
analyses SARs/STRs, provide intelligence reports to other LEAs locally and internationally, 
provides feedback to those filing SARs/STRs and ensuring annual reports containing proper 
typologies and strategic analyses.

NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The FIA should immediately designate and train a member of 
staff in carrying out strategic and operational analysis with 
respect to its functions and duties in keeping with Egmont 
principles and guidance; the strategic analysis should be 
published. 
Complete 
b) The FIA should immediately ensure that there is a distinct 
separation between the Supervisory Unit and the Financial 
Investigation Unit, which deals with Suspicious Activity Reports 
(SARs)/Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs). The two units 
should have their own separate office space where access is 
restricted to staff within the relevant unit; this will ensure that 
information is fully secured in keeping with the FATF and 
Egmont requirements. 
Complete 
c) The FIA should immediately fill the post of Senior Investigating 
Officer and other vacancies. 
Complete 
d) The FIA should dedicate more staff to analyzing SARs/STRs to 
improve the timing of such analysis. 
Largely Complete 
e) The FIA should undertake a full analysis of SARs/STRs submitted 
with a view to determining whether, based on the nature and 
characteristics of business in the Territory, FIs and DNFBPs are 
appropriately filing SARs/STRs. 
Complete 
f) 
The FIA should finalize its risk assessment framework manual for 
supervised entities – NPOs, DNFBPs and HVG Dealers. 
Complete 
g) The FIA should develop written guidelines on AML/CFT 
compliance for the guidance of all entities under its 
supervision, including the DNFBP and NPO sectors in order to 
ensure greater understanding and compliance with their 
obligations. 
Largely Complete 
h) A full analysis of the roles and functions of the Steering 
Committee (SC) must be carried out to ascertain whether the 
structure is optimal for the receipt and analysis of SARs/STRs 
and, if necessary, to carry out necessary reforms, including 
advising on reforms to the Financial Investigation Agency Act 
(FIAA). 
Largely Complete 
i) 
As the FIA is responsible for carrying out inspections and 
investigations, conducting supervisory activities and 
processing of SARs/STRs, it is essential for the FIA to conduct a 
self-assessment (considering the FATF Recommendations) that 
would assist in remedying the deficient areas identified in 
relation to the organization, and also in ascertaining what is 
needed to accomplish the various tasks (investigations, 
inspections, supervisory activities and processing of 
SARs/STRs). 
Complete 
j) 
The FIA should review the effectiveness of its current 
document control and management procedures and revise 
them on a regular basis to ensure their currency; this should 
extend to all other procedure manuals in place. 
Largely Complete 
k) The FIA should make a full assessment of its resource needs 
and ensure that it has sufficient resources to efficiently and 
effectively carry out both its supervisory and investigative 
functions; this should include maximizing the use of currently 
available resources. 
Largely Complete 
l) 
The FIA should ensure that adequate and timely feedback is 
provided to entities that file SARs/STRs in accordance with the 
Largely Complete 
requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing Code of Practice (AMLTFCOP). 
m) The FIA’s SOPs manual needs to be updated and reissued as 
a matter of urgency. 
Complete 
n) The FIA should implement procedures to capture data on the 
number of extensions granted when requests are made to 
entities for information and the reason(s) given for seeking the 
extension. 
Complete 
o) The FIA should liaise with the RVIPF to develop proper 
protocols and procedures in relation to the timely processing 
of Interpol requests; this should include a review of the MOU 
with the RVIPF to establish the deficiencies within the MOU 
and agree on appropriate amendments that will make the 
MOU a truly helpful workable document; it should also include 
an agreement on timeliness of processing. 
Complete 
p) The FIA should liaise with the AGC to develop protocols and 
procedures in relation to all international cooperation 
requests to ensure timely processing, including the provision of 
responses; these protocols and procedures should be 
reviewed and updated regularly to ensure continued 
effectiveness, especially in the context of changing standards 
on international cooperation. 
Complete 
q) The FIA should risk assess all DNFBPs and NPOs and develop a 
supervisory plan which includes onsite inspection 
management meetings, industry meetings, periodic reports 
for off-site analysis, and guidance for each section on a 
defined periodic basis, taking into account the risks relative to 
each and thus ensure the proper allocation of resources. 
Largely Complete 
r) 
The FIA should increase its oversight of the DNFBP and NPO 
sectors (the HVG sector is assessed as posing relatively low 
risk) by carrying out more onsite inspections; this should 
include a monitoring process that is conducted on a 
continual basis but placing more emphasis on areas that

s) The FIA should put mechanisms in place to identify those 
DNFBPs and NPOs that are operating without registration 
and/or authorization and take measures to ensure that all 
DNFBPs and NPOs are appropriate registered; in order to 
facilitate this process, the FIA should develop a Cabinet 
Paper seeking approval for legislative reform to mandate the 
compulsory registration with the FIA of all DNFBPs (as is 
currently the case with NPOs in relation to the NPO Board).

The FIA should continue to provide outreach to all DNFBPs, 
HVGs and NPOs to familiarize them with the requirements of 
the AML/CFT legislation and the expectations of the FIA in 
ensuring compliance therewith.

u) The SC should assume and perform its functions as mandated 
by the FIAA. Where it is considered that the SC’s functions 
would be better performed by the Director, serious 
consideration should be given to reforming the FIAA to 
properly place those functions in the Director and either limit 
the responsibilities of the SC or do away with the SC 
altogether.

v) If the SC is to be retained and therefore remain functional it 
should develop its own internal operating procedures which 
deal with the processes engaged in considering SARs/STRs

y) The FIA should maintain statistical data on the number of 
AML/CFT compliance manuals received for approval 
pursuant to regulation 3 (3) of the Anti-Money Laundering 
Regulations (AMLR); this should result in the development of 
relevant statistics outlining the number and types of institutions 
for which approvals have been granted.

of each other, including identifying areas of challenge and 
how the challenges may be effectively managed and 
overcome; this will help to remove the discrepancies in 
procedures, in particular, to ensure the proper streamlining of 
statistical data in relation to criminal cases investigated and 
prosecuted.

aa) The Board of the FIA should identify and appoint an 
independent person versed in AML/CFT issues, including the 
FATF 40 Recommendations, to oversee and supervise the 
implementation by the FIA of the above recommendations in 
order to ensure proper and timely delivery of positive results; 
the appointed person should carry out internal audits on a 
periodic basis as a means of testing the FIA’s compliance with 
its obligations and the recommendations within the NRAR. This 
recommendation is without prejudice to the establishment of 
an Implementation Unit to ensure compliance with all 
recommendations continued in the NRAR.

The FSC has been diligent in completing the recommendations provided within the 2016 
NRAR. They have made progress with all of the recommendations and have implemented a 
series of amendments to legislation, actions and internal controls to aid them. Most 
recommendations are continuous in nature and the FSC has displayed that they are 
monitoring these activities, whether on a quarterly or annual basis. The staffing needs of the 
FSC are continuously being updated by decreasing the number of vacancies, while 
increasing the training and professional needs of staff. The FSC needs to take concrete steps 
to demonstrate effectiveness as a supervisor by increasing its onsite inspections, fully 
implementing its risk-based supervision and completing necessary amendments to the 
AML/CFT regime. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS

Inspections, Fiduciary Services and Enforcement Unit. 
c) The FSC should intensify the number and scope of its 
inspections to cover a wider cross-section of regulated 
entities, with particular reference to the securities sector. 
Largely Complete 
d) The FSC should ensure that compliance inspection reports are 
written and issued timely so as to be of value to the licensees 
to which they relate; it should review its compliance 
inspection manual to ensure appropriate time frames are 
outlined and strictly adhered to and, in particular, the time 
between the date of inspection and date of issuance of the 
final report should be appropriately benchmarked.  
Partially Complete 
e) The FSC should immediately complete its risk assessment 
framework including its manual for risk assessments. 
Complete 
f) 
The FSC should immediately take steps to ensure that all 
licensees are appropriately risk assessed and rated so as to 
effectively deploy its resources. 
Complete 
g) The FSC should make an assessment of the effectiveness of its 
enforcement mechanisms, including monetary penalties to 
determine whether they are able to deter, or have deterred, 
“bad behavior” or increased compliance, and document 
such determination on a periodic basis; this should lead to 
reforms, where considered necessary. 
Complete 
h) The FSC should take immediate steps to reduce the time it 
takes to respond to requests for information from foreign CAs. 
Complete 
i) 
The FSC should establish a special fund into which 
administrative penalties collected are paid; it should also 
outline a mechanism for use of the fund and identify areas of 
support, such as training, investigations or other appropriate 
purposes, taking into account the matters outlined in 
Interpretive Note 38 of Recommendation 38.

j) 
The FSC should consider putting in place written measures to 
encourage feedback from other CAs on assistance provided 
to them so that it can better review from time to time its 
international cooperation regime. 
Complete 
k) The FSC should take steps to finalize the Crisis Management 
Group manual. 
Complete 
l) 
The FSC should continue to take measures to ensure that its 
licensees and other legal persons are not abused or misused 
for ML/TF or other criminal activity, which would include being 
in a position to fully assess the risks posed by such licensees 
and other legal persons and take appropriate measures to 
deal with such risks. 
Complete 
m) The FSC should benchmark itself against the relevant FATF 
Recommendations Methodology for assessing compliance 
with those Recommendations. 
Complete 
n) The FSC should develop and institute an internal audit 
function of its adherence to policies and procedures 
including service standards administered or overseen directly 
by the Managing Director and provide periodic reports to the 
Board of Commissioners; this will enhance the FSC’s 
governance structure and adherence to established 
standards, whether of internal or external origin. 
Largely Complete 
o) The FSC should put in writing its assessment of the ML/TF risks of 
the business it supervises so as to inform its overall allocation

of resources between sectors. This could be done in 
conjunction with the risk assessment framework. 
p) The FSC should develop a corrective action plan to mitigate 
the deficiencies (risks and vulnerabilities) identified in the 
NRAR. This plan should also include measures that would 
enable continuous effective management and monitoring of 
the measures currently in place to prevent any otherwise 
avoidable shortcoming. The implementation of the corrective 
action plan should be monitored carefully by the FSC 
(preferably by a designated functionary within the FSC) by 
carrying out internal audits on a periodic basis.

With the implementation of the International Tax Authority Act, the ITA is now a statutory 
body. Most recommendations are a work in progress as the ITA is currently settling in and 
making updates where they are due. However, the ITA has made significant improvement 
with regard to the recommendations, especially in data security, staffing needs and 
legislative reform. The confidentiality recommendation remains mandatory for staff. The ITA is 
now in a better position to implement the recommendations from the NRAR. 
 
The ITA should continue to pursue an update of the ITA Act to accommodate the 
application of compulsory powers in cases where information is not produced. This should be 
handled in conjunction with the ODPP. A system for monitoring the accounting records of 
companies and limited partnerships should be implemented by the ITA, in conjunction with 
the FSC, to abide by the recommendations of the Global Peer Review Report.

stored and maintained in the offices of the ITA. 
Complete 
h) In view of the fact that the ITA, in the execution of its duties, is 
bound by confidentiality rules in dealing with requests for 
assistance and in the context of its information exchange

renew their oaths of confidentiality; this will ensure that staff 
keep attuned to their obligations in maintaining the 
confidentiality of information received from and/or 
transmitted to foreign CAs.

The BVIAA has implemented a Hazard and Risk Assessment Register which allows them to 
apply a risk-based approach towards their duties. The BVIAA is currently working on ways to 
have staff trained via online learning. The Aviation Security Unit has approved Standard 
Operating Procedures, which are maintained, for contraband, drugs, weapons, explosives 
and activities relating to ML/TF. The BVIAA has implemented a Bomb Threat Checklist to 
safely guide staff on the procedures for any threats in which the Airports may face. The 
security staff of the BVIAA is trained on an annual basis for the detection of items related to 
ML and TF. Police, Immigration, Customs and Airport Management (PICAM) is now known as 
the Safety and Security Action Group (SSAG). The SSAG meets on a quarterly basis to discuss 
matters relating to the proper functioning of the Territory’s airports. 
 
To ensure security and safety at all functioning airports, the BVIAA should ensure that there is 
at least one arresting officer at the airport during operational hours. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The BVIAA should carry out periodically a risk assessment of its 
security measures at all the airports to determine areas that 
pose the most risk and provide appropriate resources to deal 
with those risks. Such assessment should pay particular 
attention to the risk of terrorism including how to deal with in 
an efficient and effective manner the discovery of unlawful 
weapons and explosives.

that may affect the execution of its mandate, could be 
identified, assessed and appropriately risk rated. 
c) The BVIAA should immediately prepare guidelines setting out 
qualifications of Authorized Officers and make appropriate 
recommendations to the responsible Minister to expand its 
cadre of Authorized Officers to be stationed at all of the 
airports; this will ensure efficiency in its law enforcement 
machinery. 
Partially Complete 
d) The BVIAA should immediately prepare written policies and 
procedures to be discussed and agreed with the RVIPF, HMC 
and ID on the referral of breaches or violations that occur in 
and around airport premises. 
Complete 
e) The written policies and procedures referred to above, should 
be crystalized in a formal MOU setting out the circumstances 
under which information should be exchanged and matters 
referred; this should include a process for providing updates 
on the progress and outcome of information exchanged and 
matters referred. 
Complete 
f) 
The joint meetings of PICAM should be convened more 
regularly, at least once each quarter, and records of 
meetings and decisions taken should be provided and 
maintained by the BVIAA; this should help to improve the 
level of cooperation between its members and minimize 
threats and otherwise avoidable vulnerabilities to the airports. 
Complete 
g) All senior members of staff as well as the security and other 
enforcement staff at the BVIAA should be provided with 
training on relevant security and investigative techniques, 
including those geared towards identifying risks related to 
ML/TF issues; training should also include the FATF 40 
Recommendations and FATF Methodology as relevant in 
detecting and preventing ML/TF activity through the airports, 
and the training should be organized regularly and on a 
periodic basis in order to keep staff attuned to current and 
emerging trends in security issues which may relate to or 
affect the operations of the airports.

Policy, etc. Security logs are maintained and updated on a daily basis. However, statistics 
are not currently being analyzed by the BVIPA, which is a risk that needs to be dealt with as a 
matter of urgency. 
 
To enhance the teamwork amongst the HMC, BVIPA, ID and RVIPF in regard to the migrant 
smuggling operations, policies and procedures should be developed and abided by. The 
recording of all incidents on port premises should be documented and reported to the 
respective persons electronically and recorded with a log, which is monitored to ensure 
there are solutions and risk mitigation measures for all incidents. The BVIPA should ensure all 
statistics, which are being recorded, are analyzed to seek out any trends or measuring in 
which may assist with avoiding any threats or vulnerabilities in the future, and the 
development of mitigation measures. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The BVIPA should immediately prepare written policies and 
procedures to guide its staff in detecting cases of 
interference in the work of the BVIPA and creating an 
effective reporting chain to enable the BVIPA to carry out its 
mandate efficiently and effectively; the policies and 
procedures must be geared towards preventing interference 
by Government, political persons, law enforcement personnel 
and interest groups.

c) The BVIPA should immediately develop its own written 
procedures for the detection of smuggled and undeclared 
goods entering through the ports and such procedures must 
include appropriate measures to minimize the risks that may 
be associated with ML/TF activity in and around the port or in 
relation to persons (both natural and legal) that have business 
transactions with the BVIPA; this will buttress the efforts of  
HMC in preventing the smuggling of goods and contraband 
and detecting undeclared goods.

d) Immediate steps should be taken to train senior members of 
the staff of the BVIPA (particularly the Managing Director) on 
the functions, powers and remit of the BVIPA and how the 
functions and powers may be performed and exercised 
optimally; the training should extend to AML/CFT issues. 
Partially Complete 
e) The BVIPA should make immediate arrangements for its 
security and other enforcement staff to receive training in 
crime detection and investigative techniques; the training 
should extend to ML/TF issues, basic understanding on 
predicate offences for ML/TF, the FATF 40 Recommendations, 
FATF Methodology, and UN Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (specifically with respect to the provisions 
on smuggling). 
Partially Complete 
f) 
The BVIPA should establish a long-term training program for its 
staff, and training on key aspects of the program in relation to 
the BVIPA’s execution of its duties should be conducted on a 
periodic basis to ensure continuity and relevance of 
knowledge and skills. 
Partially Complete 
g) The BVIPA should review its processes and procedures with 
regard to port security and conduct periodic tests of the 
efficacy and effectiveness of the security measures in place; 
this process should entail a risk assessment of its security 
measures at all the ports under its administration to determine 
areas that pose the most risk and provide appropriate 
resources to deal with those risks. 
Partially Complete 
h) The BVIPA should, as a matter of priority, implement a risk 
rating system whereby security breaches or any other matter 
that may affect the execution of its mandate, could be

i) 
The BVIPA should seek to forge a closer working relationship 
with the RVIPF, HMC and ID (in relation to the smuggling of 
migrants through the ports) in order to ensure appropriate

The MC remains severely understaffed. Efforts have been made to secure additional funding 
and resources since the NRA exercise; such efforts have yet to yield positive returns. A 
request for additional staff and equipment to aid the MC with implementing the NRA 
Recommendations was made during the 2020 budget cycle; however, no resources were 
provided to the MC to date. Training is lacking within the MC and due to the shortage of 
staff, there is a backlog with regard to updating the electronic filing system. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The MC should immediately undertake an assessment of its 
human resources needs to effectively address the delays 
associated with the proper and full utilization of the Judicial 
Enforcement Management System (JEMS) and the timely 
preparation and submission of records of appeal; the results 
of the assessment should be shared with the Deputy 
Governor’s Office (DGO) which should explore avenues for 
obtaining relevant resources to strengthen the work of the 
MC, as a matter of urgency. 
Complete 
b) The DGO should immediately take steps to restore the Police 
Security for the Magistrates; in addition, it should ensure that 
there is physical presence at all the MC premises of security 
personnel during official working hours, including all other 
periods when the Magistrates are on the MC premises to 
perform their duties.

and to ensure that such resources are provided in the shortest 
time possible. 
d) The MC should immediately take steps to provide or ensure 
the provision of a proper records management system 
whereby records can be easily accessed and readily 
retrievable; this should include establishing an electronic filing 
and storage system. 
Partially Complete 
e) The records management system referred to in 
Recommendation D above should be sufficiently efficient to 
allow for the recording of complaints received and disposed 
(including how they are disposed), criminal cases prosecuted 
before the MC, convictions and acquittals, which cases 
resulted in the imposition of fines and which in the imposition 
of terms of imprisonment, seizures and confiscations ordered, 
whether any included a ML/TF prosecution and conviction, 
and such other information as may be considered relevant 
for statistical purposes. 
Largely Complete 
f) 
The MC should undertake a periodic review and analysis of 
the data recorded pursuant to Recommendation D above to 
establish where risks exist (if any) and determine what steps 
should be taken or what recommendations to make to 
ensure the proper and adequate mitigation of those risks; any 
such reviews and analyses should be properly recorded, 
easily accessible and readily retrievable. 
Largely Complete 
g) The MC should put in place an appropriate structure to 
ensure the continued functioning of the MC in the absence 
of the Court Manager; this may be carried out by identifying 
at least 2 other senior staff, who should be trained and 
involved from time to time in the work of the Court Manager, 
so they may develop the necessary experience to function in 
that office effectively in the absence of the Court Manager.

h) The MC should immediately develop written policies and 
procedures to specifically deal with complaints and issues of 
bribery and corruption in relation to staff and the MC 
generally.

The HC has not made any noticeable progress in addressing the NRA Recommendations 
Similar issues exist as with the MC in terms of resources and training.  
 
The HC should take appropriate measures to ensure that the statistical data maintained is 
being comprehensively used to track trends, mitigate risks and assist with the improvements 
of the office of the Supreme Court. All archived files of the HC should be scanned and filed 
on a secured server for easily accessibility and the safety of staff. An electronic filing system 
should be created and managed by the HC. Security measures should be implemented by 
the HC, inside the courtroom and the entire HC Registry premises. The HC should undertake a 
mandatory risk assessment, which would assist with identifying any current risks, threats or 
vulnerabilities that may impair the work of the HC. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) The HC should develop a training program to enable its staff, 
including all legal staff, to receive training on AML/CFT 
matters, FATF 40 Recommendations and FATF Methodology; 
the training program should embrace training on conflicts of 
interest and bribery and corruption.

The RVIPF has implemented most of their recommendations to some degree and are in the 
process of completing the remainder. Officers are being added to the RVIPF to assist with the 
needs of the RVIPF. The RVIPF has enhanced their border security regime with the addition of 
a boat, additional officers, development of a marine auxiliary/volunteer force to and 
expand the marine capacity. The IT architecture was enhanced by the updating of the 
Overseas Territories Criminal Intelligence System (OTRCIS) database, the RVIPF email system, 
video surveillance, body worn cameras, Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 
and the Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS). Training programs have been 
developed for the Basic Financial Investigations Course and the Cash Seizure, Terrorist 
Financing and Proceeds of Crime. The RVIPF participates virtually in courses offered by the 
FSC and other agencies. The staff complement of the FCU has increased. A complete review 
of the FCU will be conducted by the City of London Police. To assist with the policies and 
procedures of investigations, an Investigative Manual is currently drafted. On an annual 
basis, a comprehensive report is completed by the RVIPF, which is laid before the House of 
Assembly. 
 
The RVIPF should ensure all staff is currently trained based on their respective duties. Further, 
focus must be placed on ensuring that investigations are done to ensure the proceeds are 
taken out of crime through increase confiscation, seizures and forfeitures. Focus should also 
be placed on fully resourcing the FCU and other related Units responsible for directly 
connecting investigations of financial and other crimes related to ML/TF/PF. 
 
 
 
NRA RECOMMENDATIONS 
General Recommendations 
a) Immediately develop a training program for all levels of the 
RVIPF. Identify training opportunities for its officers on an 
ongoing basis (especially those on the investigative side) and 
conduct regular and periodic training; such training should 
include investigative techniques taking into account modern 
technology as a tool in combatting crime, including ML/TF. 
Largely Complete 
b) Immediately develop processes and procedures to maximize 
its available resources so that they can be properly leveraged 
by committing more of those resources to identified areas of 
high risk; in so doing, the RVIPF should at all times adopt a risk-
based approach in the execution of its duties. 
Largely Complete 
c) Immediately prepare and implement written internal policies 
and procedures with respect to the handling, processing, 
investigation and referral of criminal cases (for approval

Take immediate steps to ensure that comprehensive statistics 
of the offences committed in the VI are accurately compiled 
on an ongoing basis to ensuring that data is available from 
each unit within the RVIPF and that all relevant persons 
understand how to record the data and are able to access 
such, and are properly trained to record and analyze the 
data to identify areas of high risk to which more resources are 
to be applied; consideration should be given to centralizing 
all compiled data which must be easily accessible and 
retrievable. In this regard, compiled statistics should include 
information on: 
o 
The number of ML/TF investigations and referrals for 
prosecutions on an annual and ongoing basis; 
o 
The number of predicate offense investigations and 
referrals for prosecutions on an annual and ongoing 
basis; 
o 
The number of ML/TF and predicate offences referred 
for prosecution on an annual basis that have not 
been pursued and whether reasons are given in each 
case; and

There is an NRA Implementation Team within the HMC, which assists with the NRA 
Recommendations. This team works diligently on the implementation of the 
recommendations outlined in the NRA, drafting of procedural manuals and code of ethics. 
Once the documents are finalized, the NRA Team will be conducting regular operational 
audits. The priority recommendation for a Procedural Manual on record keeping is greatly 
required by HMC as there are currently no procedures in place for this recommendation, 
which leaves the agency’s internal controls exposed. The human resource needs of HMC are 
being assessed. HMC, in collaboration with the Immigration Department and the RVIPF, and 
led by the Commissioner of Customs, have created a Joint Border Security Task Force. All 
plans in association with this Task Force are updated on a monthly basis. HMC is currently 
sourcing training for the detection, investigation and prosecution of TF. Additionally, HMC 
utilizes the OTRCIS database, which is a major improvement in the information sharing 
capabilities of the agency with domestic and territorial law enforcement agencies. 
 
It is imperative for HMC to have an officer(s) that is trained to assist the ODPP and the RVIPF 
with case files and prosecution, where necessary.

The ID has identified the need for the Immigration Act to be completely reviewed, and a 
number of amendments are currently being worked on. Training was completed on safety to 
assist the Officers of the ID. The ID continues to struggle with the development of internal 
procedures for detecting, documents and handling incidents of bribery and corruption; 
training is required in these areas. Domestic and international cooperation has significantly 
improved due to the establishment of the Joint Border Security Task Force, which includes the 
ID, RVIPF and HMC. 
 
The ID should be provided with immediate training in detecting, investigating and 
prosecuting TF. The ID should develop its own policies and procedures to ensure all staff 
abides by the rules and regulations of the ID. The ID should implement a monitoring and 
reporting mechanism, to ensure staff is protected when reporting cases of bribery and 
corruption.

should concentrate on the obligations required of the VI in 
forestalling and preventing criminal activity, including the 
activity of ML/TF and equip Immigration Officers with 
knowledge on investigative techniques and identifying 
suspicious activities. Training should also include all FATF 
predicate offences for ML as well as methods on identifying

The ODPP is actively involved in consultation with and guiding the RVIPF and HMC in all 
investigations. In collaboration with DoIT, they are attempting to make DOCCOVA useful to 
the ODPP. This will serve as a modern case file management system for the ODPP. The DPP 
has submitted legislative amendments to the AGC, to assist with streamlining processes for 
the respective CAs and LEAs as it related to MLAs, extraditions and the successful 
prosecution of ML/TF cases. Further, the DPP is the Chairman of the Committee of Law 
Enforcement Agencies (CLEA), which was developed to ensure greater coordination and 
collaboration in the fight against ML, TF and other organized crime, through intelligences 
sharing, the joint pursuit and apprehension of criminals and the disruption of criminal activity. 
 
With the addition of new staff, the ODPP should ensure all staff is properly trained and/or 
exposed to AML/CFT international standards such as the FATF 40 Recommendations, FATF 
Methodology and the Mutual Evaluation process. To ensure that all MLAs and extraditions 
are being processed as efficiently and effectively as possible, the AGC and DPP should 
ensure there is adequate and timely cooperation and coordination, including where 
legislative amendments are necessary to improve the extradition process.

i) 
A working group or committee comprising the ODPP, FIA, 
HMC, ID and RVIPF should be formed to deal with 
coordination and cooperation between the agencies; the 
group or committee should be chaired by the DPP and meet 
on a regular basis to discuss and provide assistance to the 
workings of each other, including identifying areas of 
challenges and how those challenges may be effectively 
managed and overcome.

j) 
The ODPP and AGC should develop close cooperation 
measures (which should be outlined in writing) with each 
other in order to ensure the proper, efficient and effective 
processing of MLA and extradition matters; in addition, the 
ODPP should identify any shortcoming in the criminal laws, 
which may hinder the successful prosecution of ML/TF cases 
and discuss with the AGC identified areas of reform which the 
AG should take forward to the enactment stage. 
Partially Complete 
k) The ODPP should develop a corrective action plan to 
mitigate the deficiencies (risks and vulnerabilities) identified in 
the NRAR. This plan should also include measures that would 
enable continuous effective management and monitoring of 
the measures currently in place to prevent any otherwise 
avoidable shortcoming. The implementation of the corrective 
action plan should be monitored carefully by the ODPP 
(preferably by a designated functionary within the ODPP) by 
carrying out internal audits on a periodic basis.

Freezing, Seizures Confiscation and Forfeiture Recommendations 
l) 
There is need for adequate and consistent training of 
prosecutors on confiscation matters so that confiscation forms 
an integral part of the prosecution of predicate offences 
(while acknowledging at the same time that similar training is 
required for the Policy in their conduct of investigations in 
order to better aid any pursuit of confiscation proceedings by 
the prosecution).

m) The implementation of a more robust case management 
system and policy as it relates to confiscation would be 
beneficial in tracing and recovering assets. 
Partially Complete 
n) The ODPP should, as a matter of priority, prepare and issue 
necessary guidelines to staff and the RVIPF, as well as other 
relevant LEAs, on asset confiscation, including the procedures 
to follow in relation thereto; this will lead to better and more 
effective coordination between the ODPP, RVIPF and other 
LEAs.

o) The ODPP should actively pursue with the VI Government, 
while at the same time seeking the cooperation of the AGC, 
the need for reforming the PCCA to enable an application 
for a confiscation order from the Court without the need to 
link such an application to a predicate offense (the 
equivalent provision of Section 35A (2) of the DTOA should be 
adopted); alternatively, consideration may be given to 
developing and enacting a civil forfeiture legislation with 
appropriate safeguards on individual rights and freedoms.

Terrorist and Proliferation Financing Recommendations 
p) The current PF legislation is 6 years old and does not cover 
some of the elements listed in Recommendation 7 of the FATF 
Recommendations. It would be prudent, therefore, for the 
legislation to be reviewed and amendments made, where 
necessary, to bring it into line with the current FATF 
requirements on PF.

q) In reviewing the legislation, consideration should be given to 
allowing directions to be issued by the FIA where the 
development, production or facilitation of such development 
or production of WMDs poses a threat to any country outside 
the current limitation of the VI and the UK.

r) 
The ODPP should be provided immediate training in 
detecting, investigating and prosecuting TF.

CONCLUSION 
 
The BVI conducted its first NRA exercise from 2014-2015. The resulting NRA Report was issued 
in 2016, which displayed the threats and vulnerabilities the Territory faced in relation to ML/TF. 
In August 2018, a Progress Report was issued on the status of the implementation of the NRA 
Recommendations.  
 
Since then, the AML/CFT Implementation Unit, whose role has been to keep the NRAR up to 
date and assess any changes in AML/CFT risk of the Virgin Islands, has been working diligently 
with each of the agencies to assist with the ongoing implementation of the 
recommendations. The Unit’s work involves a continuous assessment and update of the 
NRAR, and, on an ongoing basis, provides analysis of the impact of implementing the 
recommendations on the overall AML/CFT risk in the Virgin Islands. 
 
In August 2020, the AML/CFT Implementation Unit completed desk-based monitoring of the 
agencies to ensure that progress was being made, despite the COVID-19 implications. 
 
This report outlines the AML/CFT deficiencies identified for each CA and LEA in the initial 
NRAR and measures their progress in addressing their deficiencies to date.  
 
Overall, agencies implemented or largely implemented 68% of recommendations made in 
the NRAR with a further 27% partially implemented.  
 
 
 
Therefore, the Virgin Islands has significantly implemented the recommendations within the 
NRAR and increased its technical compliance with the FATF’s 40 Recommendations, and its 
effectiveness in forestalling ML, TF and PF. 
 
The AML/CFT Implementation Unit will continue to work with each of the agencies to ensure 
the recommendations displayed within the 2016 NRAR and fully implemented, and 
monitored, and that the AML/CFT risk assessments of the Virgin Islands are kept up to date.
