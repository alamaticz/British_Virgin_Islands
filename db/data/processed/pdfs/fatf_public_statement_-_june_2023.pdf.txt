FATF PUBLIC STATEMENTS – JUNE 2023 
 
The Financial Action Task Force (“the FATF”) has issued its latest public statements identifying 
jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter financing of 
terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes: 
 
1. High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action – 22 June 2023; and 
2. Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring – 23 June 2023.  
 
High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for Action  
 
A. High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call to Apply Countermeasures  
 
DPRK - the FATF remains concerned by the DPRK’s failure to address the significant deficiencies 
in its AML/CFT and has serious concerns with the threat posed by the DPRK’s illicit activities 
related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its financing (PF).  
Jurisdictions are urged to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business 
relationships and transactions with the DPRK, including DPRK companies, financial institutions, 
and those acting on their behalf.  
 
Jurisdictions are also urged to apply effective countermeasures and targeted financial sanctions in 
accordance with applicable United Nations Security Council Resolutions, to protect financial 
sectors from ML/TF/PF risks emanating from the DPRK.  
 
Iran – the FATF remains concerned with the TF risk emanating from Iran and the threat this poses 
to the international financial system given Iran’s failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist 
Financing Conventions in line with FATF Standards and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective 
counter measures.   
 
Persons should refer to the FATF statement on these jurisdictions adopted in February 2020.   
While the statement may not necessarily reflect the most recent status in Iran and the DPRK’s 
AML/CFT regime, the FATF’s call for action on these high-risk jurisdictions remains in effect. 
 
B. High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call to Apply ECDD Measures   
Myanmar remains on the FATF’s list of countries subject to a call for action based on its 
continued lack of progress to complete its action plan to address deficiencies identified in its 
Mutual Evaluation Report.  As such, the FATF has called on its members and urges all jurisdictions 
to apply enhanced due diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from business relations 
and transactions with Myanmar.  However, countries should ensure that flows of funds for 
humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not disrupted.

Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring 
There are currently 26 countries under and subject to increased monitoring by the FATF, otherwise 
referred to as a ‘grey list.’  Since the February review, the FATF has listed Cameroon, Croatia 
and Yemen.  These countries are actively working with the FATF to address the strategic 
deficiencies within their AML/CFT/CPF regimes.  
 
There is no requirement to apply enhanced due diligence measures to these jurisdictions.  The 
FATF calls for the application of a risk-based approach when dealing with these countries and 
encourages its members and all jurisdictions to take into account the information presented in the 
updated statements provided in the links below when carrying out their risk analysis.  
 
Statements issued in February 2023 in relation to Haiti, Nigeria, Syria, Tanzania, and Yemen 
are also included but may not necessarily reflect the most recent status of these jurisdictions’ 
AML/CFT regime as these countries chose to defer reporting.

The British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“the FSC”) wishes to advise the 
general public, including all persons who are required to comply with the requirements of the Anti-
Money Laundering Regulations, 2008 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 
Code of Practice, 2008, to note the concerns expressed by the FATF with respect to the named 
jurisdictions and consider the associated money laundering and/or terrorist financing risks.  The 
FSC encourages all to apply appropriate or enhanced customer due diligence measures when 
dealing with customers or handling transactions connected with any of the jurisdictions that have 
been identified by the FATF’s public statements.
