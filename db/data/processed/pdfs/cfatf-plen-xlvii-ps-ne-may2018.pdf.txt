jurisdictions of the Caribbean Basin Region which have agreed to implement the international standards 
for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), the Financial 
Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF Recommendations) in order to protect the international 
financial system from money laundering and financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risks and to encourage 
greater compliance with the AML/CFT standards, the CFATF identified jurisdictions that have strategic 
deficiencies and works with them to address those deficiencies that pose a risk to the international 
financial system. 
 
 
Jurisdiction no longer subject to the CFATF ICRG review process.

In light of the forthcoming 4th Round Mutual Evaluation of Haiti, the CFATF May 2018 Plenary 
agreed that Haiti be removed from the CFATF ICRG process. The outstanding deficiencies will be 
assessed as part of the 4th Round Process. Therefore, Haiti is no longer subject to monitoring by 
CFATF ICRG. 
 
The CFATF will continue to work with Haiti towards strengthening its AML/CFT framework and 
ensuring that the jurisdiction is fully prepared for the 4th Round Mutual Evaluation.
