CFATF - Public Statement  
 
Georgetown, Guyana, November 15th, 2017 
 
 
The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) is an organisation comprised of twenty-five 
jurisdictions of the Caribbean Basin Region, which have agreed to implement the international 
standards for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), the 
Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF Recommendations) in order to protect the 
international financial system from money laundering and financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risks 
and to encourage greater compliance with the AML/CFT standards, the CFATF identified 
jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies and works with them to address those deficiencies that 
pose a risk to the international financial system. 
 
 
 
Jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that has made significant progress in 
addressing its deficiencies.  
 
Haiti 
 
The CFATF acknowledges the progress made by Haiti in improving its AML/CFT regime 
(including significantly addressing the deficiencies that allowed Haiti to exit the 3rd Round 
Follow-Up Process) and notes that Haiti must continue to take measures to address the 
outstanding deficiencies that the CFATF had identified through the agreed action Plan.  
 
Haiti is encouraged to increase the pace of the reform process, including the passage of remaining 
legislative measures, and demonstrate further progress by the May 2018 Plenary. 
 
Haiti and the CFATF should continue to work together to ensure that its Action Plan is fully 
implemented.
