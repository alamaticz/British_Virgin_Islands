High-Risk JurisdicƟons
subject to a Call for
AcƟon – 30 June 2020
High-risk jurisdicƟons have signiﬁcant strategic deﬁciencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist ﬁnancing,
and ﬁnancing of proliferaƟon. For all countries idenƟﬁed as high-risk, the FATF calls on all members and urges all jurisdicƟons
to apply enhanced due diligence, and in the most serious cases, countries are called upon to apply counter-measures to
protect the internaƟonal ﬁnancial system from the ongoing money laundering, terrorist ﬁnancing, and proliferaƟon ﬁnancing
(ML/TF/PF) risks emanaƟng from the country. This list is oŌen externally referred to as the “black list”.  
On 28 April 2020, the FATF decided on a general pause in the review process for the list of high-risk jurisdicƟons subject to a
call for acƟon. Therefore, please refer to the list of High-Risk JurisdicƟons subject to a Call for AcƟon adopted in February 2020.
While the statement may not necessarily reﬂect the most recent status in Iran and the DemocraƟc People’s Republic of
Korea’s AML/CFT regime, the FATF’s call for acƟon on these high-risk jurisdicƟons remains in eﬀect.
