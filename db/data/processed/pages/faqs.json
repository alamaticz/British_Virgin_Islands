The BVI Financial Services Commission is responsible for the supervision of banks in the British Virgin Islands and does not have the authority to act as arbitrator between parties to a dispute. Albeit, if you feel that the bank has not addressed your concerns the Commission will act mainly as an intermediary, between the complainant and the bank (delete - in question), and seek to establish a factual account of the situation. The Commission will work towards determining whether any violation of laws, regulations and/or policy guidelines has occurred. Complaints are to be made in writing by letter, fax or email to the BVI Financial Services Commission (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2764484a4a4e54544e484942556745514e415444095140\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"5615393b3b3f25253f393833241634203f302535782031\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></a>).</p>\n</div> </div> </div>\n</div> <h3 class=\"views-accordion-faqs-page-header\">\n    How may I obtain a copy of the Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990?  </h3>\n<div> <div class=\"views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last\">\n<div class=\"views-field views-field-field-answer\"> <div class=\"field-content\"><p>The Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990 is a fairly large document with several amendments.
